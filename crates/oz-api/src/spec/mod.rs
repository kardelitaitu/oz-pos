//! Shared OpenAPI 3.1 document for the `oz-api` surface.
//!
//! Single source of truth for the contract served by BOTH the cloud
//! server (`apps/cloud-server`, which merges its own sync/webhook/docs
//! paths on top) and the desktop local API
//! (`apps/desktop-client/src/local_api.rs`, which serves exactly this
//! base document). Every operation carries `x-oz-scope`:
//!
//! - `"both"` — served by the cloud server AND the desktop local API
//!   (everything in this module);
//! - `"cloud"` — cloud-only (added by the cloud server's builder).
//!
//! The document is generated programmatically (no utoipa dependency —
//! spec 0047 records the migration as deliberately deferred). Drift is
//! policed by `apps/cloud-server/src/openapi_tests.rs`: the merged spec
//! must equal the route set registered in the router sources, in BOTH
//! directions.

Pass it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.\n\n## Endpoint scope\nEvery operation carries `x-oz-scope`: `both` means the endpoint is served by the cloud server AND the desktop app's loopback local API (Settings → Local API); `cloud` means cloud-server-only (sync, webhooks, docs UI). This document describes the `both` surface; the cloud server serves the merged superset at its own `/api/openapi.json`.\n\n## Versioning\nThe API is versioned by URL path prefix (`/api/v1/`). Breaking changes will ship under a new version prefix (`/api/v2/`) — the old version remains available for at least 6 months after the new one lands.\n\n## Pagination\nList endpoints accept `?limit` (default 50, max 200) and `?offset` (default 0) query parameters and return a `PaginatedResponse` envelope with `data`, `total`, `limit`, and `offset` fields.\n\n## Errors\nAll error responses share a common envelope: `{ \"error\": { \"code\": \"MACHINE_READABLE\", \"message\": \"Human description\", \"details\": [...] } }`. The `code` field is stable across versions — use it for programmatic error handling, not the message string.\n\n## Changelog\n- **Read tiers (0.0.34, spec 0047):** terminal client-credential tokens now bind the `terminal` preset — reads are gated by `permissions` claim keys (403 `insufficient_scope` when missing). Legacy tokens without the claim keep full read. The `OZ_TERMINAL_READ_TIER=full` escape hatch restores legacy terminal reads and is **deprecated** (removal after one release cycle).",
