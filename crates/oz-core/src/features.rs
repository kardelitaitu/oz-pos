//!
//! The [`Feature`] enum defines all 32 toggleable features in the
//! OZ-POS framework. A [`FeatureRegistry`] holds the currently-active
//! set and provides helpers for enabling/disabling flags with automatic
//! dependency resolution.
//!
//! Feature flags are persisted in the `settings` table as
//! `feature.<variant_name>` = `"1"` rows. The bridge between
//! [`FeatureRegistry`] and the settings store lives in `settings.rs`
//! (#6 in the core plan).
