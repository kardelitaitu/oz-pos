//! Sale-deduction result types (ADR-19 §2).
//!
//! When [`Store::complete_sale`](crate::db::Store) runs with multi-location
//! inventory, it returns either a [`CompleteSaleResult`] (all stock sufficed)
//! or a [`PartialStockResult`] (one or more lines had insufficient stock at
//! the resolved primary location). The cashier UI uses these discriminators
//! to render either a success toast or the Stock Shortfall panel.
//!
//! These types belong in `oz-core` because both the desktop-client and
//! tablet-client Tauri command layers deserialize and forward them to the
//! front-end without further transformation.
