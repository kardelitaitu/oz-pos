//! Product popularity scoring (ADR #37 D1).
//!
//! Pure, unit-tested formula: a recency-decayed, evidence-smoothed, weighted
//! blend of three signals — units sold, acted-upon searches, and product
//! edits. The formula lives here in code; the ledgers (`sale_lines` +
//! `product_activity`) keep history so the formula can be retuned without a
//! migration.
//!
//! # Formula
//!
//! ```text
//! raw_c      = Σ_t events(t) × λ^t           t = days ago, λ = 0.93, 90-day window
//! sales_raw  = raw_sales × ln(1 + distinct transactions)     breadth weighting (D6)
//! component' = mean_c + (raw_c − mean_c) × v / (m + v)     v = event count, m = 5
//! score      = 0.6·Sales' + 0.3·Search' + 0.1·Edits'
//! ```
//!
//! The sales signal is additionally **breadth-weighted**: the decayed unit
//! volume is multiplied by `ln(1 + distinct transactions)`, so the same
//! volume sold to many different customers outranks one bulk buyer — reach
//! over one-customer bulk (ADR #37 D6).
//!
//! The smoothing term shrinks the *deviation from the catalog mean* by the
//! evidence fraction `v/(m + v)`: a product with zero events sits exactly at
//! the catalog mean (fair cold start), a two-sale fluke is pulled toward the
//! mean and cannot top the list, and a high-evidence product approaches its
//! raw score (evidence wins). This refines the ADR's pseudocode, which scaled
//! a sum-scale `raw` against a count-scale `v`; the shrinkage form below
//! achieves the ADR's stated goals on the correct scale.
