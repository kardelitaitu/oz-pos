# oz-payment

Payment processor abstraction for OZ-POS.

## Status

✅ `PaymentProcessor` trait defined with the full lifecycle:
`authorize → capture → refund → void`. Includes a `sale()`
default implementation (authorize + capture in one call).

✅ `MockPaymentProcessor` — programmable test double with call
counters, one-shot decline/timeout simulation. 136 unit tests pass.

Real adapters: Stripe (`drivers/stripe.rs`), Square (`drivers/square.rs`),
QRIS (`drivers/qris.rs`), Paddle (`drivers/paddle.rs`). EMV terminal
adapter not yet implemented.
