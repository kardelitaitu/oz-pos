crate: oz-hal | status: SAFE | lint: CLEAN
findings: 0 actual unsafe blocks. #![deny(unsafe_code)] at crate root (RUST-06). Mock driver's .expect("poisoned") calls on Mutex locks are documented as test-double convention (mock always compiled per AGENTS.md). No other production unwrap/expect. Registry uses per-category RwLock with fail-open discovery; all 6 hardware traits have mock implementations. The EDC terminal slot was unified 31-08-26 (closing the bypass). WeightScale discovery gap documented in registry stamp.
next: WeightScale discovery path still open; otherwise stable | perf: N/A

// RUST-06: no unsafe code exists today; deny at crate root so any future
// unsafe addition requires an explicit, narrowly-scoped reviewable allow.
#![deny(unsafe_code)]

//! Hardware Abstraction Layer for OZ-POS.
//!
//! `oz-hal` is the seam between business logic and physical devices.
//! Business code only ever sees the trait (`BarcodeScanner`,
//! `ReceiptPrinter`, `CashDrawer`, `CustomerDisplay`, `WeightScale`) — it
//! never imports a specific driver.
//!
//! Implemented device categories: barcode scanners (USB HID, serial,
//! Bluetooth SPP, plus a TCP path), receipt printers (USB, Bluetooth, TCP)
//! with ESC/POS formatting and KDS chits, cash drawers (standalone serial
//! and printer-kick), serial customer pole displays, and weight scales.
//!
//! Card-payment terminals are mid-migration: the [`EdcTerminal`] trait is
//! defined here, but its drivers still live in
//! `crates/oz-payment/src/drivers/edc/` and are not yet registered through
//! [`registry::DriverRegistry`]. NFC readers are not implemented at all.
//!
//! Every trait has a programmable mock in [`drivers::mock`]. Tests use
//! the mocks; production code uses real drivers registered through
//! [`registry::DriverRegistry`] at startup.
