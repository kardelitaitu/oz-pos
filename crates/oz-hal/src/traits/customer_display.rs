//! `CustomerDisplay` — a secondary screen that shows the cart total
//! and line count to the customer.
//!
//! Typical hardware is a 2-line × 20-character or 2-line × 16-character
//! LCD/VFD pole display connected over serial (RS-232 or USB-to-serial).
//! The display is updated in real time as items are scanned.
