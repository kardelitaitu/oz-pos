crate: oz-hal | status: SAFE | lint: CLEAN
findings: clean — 14 driver modules, all declared, none orphaned. (The dead drivers/scanner.rs that sat here uncompiled was deleted 31-08-26.) drivers/edc/ arrived the same day from oz-payment as part of the HAL unification; its drivers are stubs, so nothing here opens a device that the trait does not model.
