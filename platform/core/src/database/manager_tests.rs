//! Tests for [`StoreDatabaseManager::delete_store_db`] (ADR #45 §4.2 follow-up).
//!
//! Deleting a store profile removed its `store_profiles` row and nothing else,
//! leaving the per-store `store-<id>.sqlite` behind in the data directory. These
//! cover the removal itself, its idempotence, the WAL/SHM sidecars, and the
//! unsafe-id refusal that keeps a path-traversal id from becoming a delete primitive.
