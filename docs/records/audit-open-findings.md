## CRM (`01-crm-module.md` — PARTIALLY REMEDIATED)

**Status:** CRM-01–CRM-11 ALL closed as of 2026-08-31 (CRM-06 was real and fixed same day; the rest verified fixed against current code).

Key items:
- ~~**CRM-02** — Customer listing does not enforce the view permission~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31** (with one residual closed same day): `list_customers_scoped`/`search_customers_scoped` enforce `customers:view` on both clients (denial-tested). **Residual found and fixed (`7967cc2d`):** the tablet still registered the legacy unguarded `get_customer` (no session, no permission, global db — cross-store read by id); replaced with `get_customer_scoped` (gated, store-scoped, denial-tested on both clients), and the dead legacy UI wrappers were removed so no caller can reach an unregistered command.
- ~~**CRM-03** — Load failures are silently rendered as an empty customer database~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31**: `loadError` state; the error view replaces the empty state when the list fails to load (`CustomerManagementScreen.tsx:465`).
- ~~**CRM-04** — Delete is immediate and delete failures are invisible~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31**: `ConfirmDialog` gates deletion (CUST-02) and a localized toast surfaces delete failures (CUST-04), both tested.
- ~~**CRM-05** — "Purchase history" documented but not exposed~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31**: `get_customer_history_scoped` + in-screen history view with load-failure retry (CUST-05 tested).
- ~~**CRM-06** — Sale-completion aggregation is not idempotent and does not validate currency~~ — **REAL, FIXED 2026-08-31 (`23b78594`+`841448ca`, unsubscription follow-up next commit)**: the handler WAS live — `platform/startup` subscribed `CrmHistoryHandler` to `sale.completed` in both shipping clients (an earlier grep that missed `platform/` produced a wrong "zero production writers" claim, corrected here). So the original bugs were production-real: no idempotency (event re-delivery double-counted spend) and no currency validation (foreign-currency sales added raw). The projection moved into the completion transaction (base currency, statement-level atomic increment, replay-safe via the finalize `changed==1` CAS — idempotency by construction) and `create_refund` reverses it proportionally at the sale-recorded rate (integer round-half-up, floor at zero). The handler's bus subscription is removed with it — running both writers would double-count every sale. 5 tests, Red-first.
- ~~**CRM-07** — Duplicate, incomplete ownership between CRM module and core persistence~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-08-31 by deletion + unsubscription**: the duplicate writer (`modules/crm/src/handlers.rs` + its `platform/startup` subscription) is gone; `Store` completion/refund is the single owner of the spend projection.
- ~~**CRM-08** — Indonesian locale incomplete~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31**: `customers.ftl`/`customers.id.ftl` at 56/56 key parity, enforced by the i18n lint + bundle-parity pre-commit gates.
- ~~**CRM-09** — Hardcoded English fallbacks~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31**: screen uses `requiredLocalized`/`getString` throughout; remaining `??` defaults are data values (empty strings, em-dash), not user-facing English.
- ~~**CRM-10** — Row action touch targets below POS minimum~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31**: `.customer-mgmt-action-btn` carries `min-height/min-width: 2.75rem` (44px).
- ~~**CRM-11** — Test coverage omits failure/authorization/destructive paths~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31**: 35 screen tests including delete-failure toast, load-failure retry, history retry; command-level permission denial tests on both clients (pre/post `7967cc2d`).

## Loyalty (`02-loyalty-module.md` — AUDITED)

**Status:** Loyalty cluster FULLY CLOSED 2026-08-31 — LOY-01 remediated; **LOY-06 CLOSED 2026-08-30** (earn now fires atomically at completion); SF-01 closed with it; **LOY-03 CLOSED 2026-08-31** (proportional refund reversal in-tx; void path proven unreachable + `void_sale` race fixed as CAS); LOY-04 verified fixed; LOY-05 verified fixed.

Key open items:
- ~~**LOY-02** — Earning points is not idempotent by sale~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-30**: migration 128 enforces a unique earn/redeem projection index (`crates/oz-core/src/db/loyalty_tests.rs:556`).
- ~~**LOY-06** (P1) — loyalty earning never fires in production~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-30**, landed in `3c23e47b` (swept by a concurrent website commit — content verified intact in HEAD; attribution recorded in the journal). Wiring (user decision: backend-atomic, base-currency): `earn_points` refactored into a connection-bound core `earn_points_with_conn` that joins the caller's transaction; `finalize_sale`/`finalize_sale_in_tx` award inside the same tx as the pending→completed transition (`changed == 1` guards replays; unique index guards races); the shortfall retry awards inline. Award uses `base_total_minor` when the CUR-02 snapshot is present (the formula is currency-naive — a low-exponent charge currency would multiply rewards). Failures logged non-fatal: a captured payment never rolls back over points. Pinned by 7 new core tests.
- ~~**SF-01** (P1, found during the LOY-06 sweep) — shortfall retry sales stuck at `pending`~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-30**, same commit: `complete_sale_with_resolved_shortfalls` wrote `status='pending'` + a 30-min expiry and nobody finalized retry sales — invisible to every report (they filter `status='completed'`) and an auto-void time bomb once the ADR-20 reaper is wired (the reaper is NOT currently wired on either client, so today's symptom is permanent-pending). The retry settles an already-captured payment → now writes `completed`, no expiry, returns `Completed`. Follow-up UX gap (open, minor): the dialog's `onComplete` still doesn't print a receipt the way the main path does.
- ~~**LOY-03** — No refund or void compensation path for earned points~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-31** (landed inside foreign commit `01d3932e` — swept while committing; content verified intact in HEAD): `create_refund` now reverses `round(award × refund/sale)` **in the same DB transaction**, capped at the not-yet-reversed remainder (cumulative refunds can never claw back more than the award). Ledger row records the full deduction (negative points, type `refund_reversal`, same sign convention as `redeem`); balance floors at zero (spent points aren't dragged negative); lifetime drops → tier demotion recomputes; `customers.loyalty_points` projection maintained. Idempotent per refund via deterministic PK `loyalty-reversal-<refund_id>`. Loyalty failure warns, never blocks the refund (policy matches the LOY-06 award hook). Semantics chosen by the user: proportional reversal. 8 tests (6 unit + 2 wiring). **Void path investigated and CLOSED as unreachable**: the transition table (`foundation/src/enums.rs`) only allows `Active→Voided` — a completed (paid, points-awarded) sale can never be voided, only refunded. That sweep did surface a real race in `void_sale`: the Active pre-check read outside the transaction and the UPDATE had no status predicate, so a concurrent finalize could be overwritten completed→voided; fixed as a compare-and-set (`AND status = 'active'`, explicit rollback on conflict).
- ~~**LOY-04** — Tier updates accept invalid business values~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31** (registry stale; re-recorded after an earlier close note was lost to a foreign tree revert): `update_tier` runs `validate_tier_config` — empty names, negative thresholds, non-positive `points_per_unit`, non-finite/non-positive multipliers and non-hex colours are rejected, plus unique-threshold and zero-tier invariants; pinned by `update_tier_rejects_invalid_values`.
- ~~**LOY-05** — Load failures are silently presented as stale or empty data~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31**: `LoyaltyManagementScreen` gates rendering on `loadError` (set from `l10nErrorMessage` in the load catch, rendered before any data view at `:225`); tier-save failures surface via `setError`. Same pattern as the LOAD-cluster compliance (localized error, never silent-empty).

## Reporting (`03-reporting-module.md` — REMEDIATED IN PART)

**Status:** security boundary and limit validation implemented; **REP-02/03/04/05/06 ALL CLOSED 2026-08-31** (REP-03 `35f76dc3`, REP-04 cloud parity `88ea4e8c`, REP-05 snapshots `8952c558`, REP-06a pie `0c7f91e1`). Remaining follow-ups recorded below: cloud email timezone parity + the offline-queue drain gap (new architectural finding).

Key open items:
- ~~**REP-02** — Revenue UI combines different currencies into one displayed total~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-30**: per-currency summing in `ui/src/features/reports/revenueTotals.ts` + DashboardScreen/SalesReportScreen tests.
- ~~**REP-04** — Report queries do not show explicit refund/void/net-sales treatment~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-30** (core `35d8bec4`; UI half landed inside foreign commit `98300bca` — content verified intact, attribution recorded in the journal): refunds never mutate the sale row, so revenue counted refunded sales at full value and the refund ledger was invisible everywhere. Daily/weekly/monthly revenue now aggregate sales and refunds via CTEs joined FULL OUTER on (period, currency) — each row carries `refund_minor` (attributed to the REFUND's own period) + `net_revenue_minor`; refund-only periods produce a row instead of dropping the refund. `refunds_summary` (per-currency count + totals) was added in core but never gained a consumer — **removed 2026-08-31** (the per-period `refund_minor` on the revenue rows already surfaces the same money in the UI; an orphaned query is exactly the dead-code shape CRM-06 proved dangerous — recoverable from `35d8bec4` if a dedicated panel is ever built). Voids were already surfaced (`voided_sales_summary`); net-sales semantics are now explicit in the row fields. SalesReportScreen shows Refunds + Net Revenue rows when the period has refunds.
- ~~**REP-06** — cross-currency SUMs in the remaining report queries~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-31** (core `38b456bd`, UI `3f9ced5c`): `top_products`, `hourly_heatmap`, `category_breakdown`, `payment_method_breakdown` and `voided_sales_summary` summed minor units across currencies into one number (the REP-02 class below the revenue trends). All five now GROUP BY currency with a `currency` field on every row; category percentages normalize WITHIN each currency; voided summary returns one row per currency; heatmap cells aggregate currency rows (orders sum, intensity tracks the display currency, labels list every amount); the refunds analytics card + its CSV are per-currency. **Follow-ups recorded:** (a) ~~the category PIE still compares slice areas across currencies — visual-semantics decision needed (per-currency pies vs currency filter)~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-31 (`0c7f91e1`)**: per-currency tabs on the pie card (display currency default, strip only when the range spans currencies) + the CSV gained its missing currency column with per-row currency formatting; (b) ~~cloud `email_pg.rs` mirrors the old single-currency shapes AND lacks REP-04 refund netting — parity slice~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-31**: the cloud already had the REP-06 per-currency shapes (note was stale; `4b8a630e`), REP-05 erasure fixed same-day, and **REP-04 netting landed in `88ea4e8c`** — the earlier "cloud schema has NO refunds table" note was WRONG: `refunds` existed in `init.pg.sql` all along (the prior grep had searched only `apps/`, missing `crates/oz-core/migrations/`); the real gaps were `tenant_id`, RLS policy, oz_app grants, cutover coverage and query wiring — all closed. `daily/weekly/monthly_revenue_pg` now mirror the local FULL OUTER netting semantics (PG rejects the correlated COGS subquery over ungrouped outer columns — E42803 — so COGS moved to a pre-aggregated CTE). **Still open:** the forecast queries (`category_popularity_pg`, `category_means_pg`) still INNER JOIN products (advisory consumers, deliberately not expanded); cloud email reports bucket in UTC — per-tenant timezone config does not exist in the cloud schema (REP-03 parity follow-up, needs a tenant-level setting + the same offset-string contract).
- ~~**REP-05** — Current product/category joins can erase or rewrite historical sales attribution~~ — **ERASE HALF CLOSED 2026-08-31 (`cd4bdaa8`)**: `top_products`/`category_breakdown` INNER JOINed the mutable products table — deleting a product silently erased its historical sales from both reports (totals stopped reconciling; the category pie inflated surviving slices). Both LEFT JOIN now: deleted products keep revenue under their stored sku and bucket into Uncategorised. **Rewrite half remains open as a design item**: renames/category moves still retroactively change historical labels because `sale_lines` stores only `sku` — fixing it needs sale-line snapshot columns (name/category at sale time), a backfill for legacy rows, and cloud-sync parity; deliberately not smuggled into this slice. **REWRITE HALF CLOSED 2026-08-31 (`8952c558`)**: `sale_lines` gained snapshot columns (`product_id`, `product_name`, `category_id` — migration `20260826_sale_line_snapshots.sql` with best-effort backfill from current products for legacy rows; PG init + cloud `create_sale` + the cutover copy tool in parity). `insert_sale_line` resolves all three in its existing single product lookup. Both reports read snapshot-first with the products join as legacy fallback — renames, category moves and sku reuse now keep every sale era on its own correctly-labelled row (5 new core tests, incl. the flipped deleted-product semantics: a snapshot keeps its TRUE category instead of bucketing to Uncategorised).
- ~~**REP-03** — Date boundaries have no store-timezone contract or input validation~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-31 (`35f76dc3`)** per the design below, with one correction to the sketch: IANA names are NOT resolved (no `chrono-tz` dep) — the stored contract is a fixed offset string `'+HH:MM'`/`'-HH:MM'` (schema default `'UTC'` normalized to `'+00:00'`; anything unparseable falls back to UTC so a misconfigured store never silently shifts money buckets). The `UTC`→`+00:00` normalization is load-bearing: SQLite 3.45 (rusqlite bundled) treats the `UTC` *modifier* as a local→UTC conversion on bare values — `DATE('now','UTC')` shifted a whole day in tests; 3.50 behaves differently; `±HH:MM` is pure arithmetic and version-stable. Threaded through ALL date-bucket queries at once: 14 `reports.rs` functions incl. the REP-04 refund CTEs, `analytics.rs` staff series, `popularity.rs` trend (scoring decay windows stay UTC by design — rolling windows, not calendar buckets), `sales.rs` today-exports (both sides of the comparison shifted) and `shifts.rs` hourly labels (window filter stays on absolute instants). Boundaries validated as strict YYYY-MM-DD (SQLite silently NULLs garbage — a mistyped bound used to vanish rows instead of erroring). UI submits store-local boundary dates: `rangeForGranularity`/`cardRange`/presets/custom defaults anchor to the primary store day via `getPrimaryStoreScoped` (device-local legacy until the profile loads). **Open residual:** no settings UI exists to edit `store_profiles.timezone` (API + SQL only — the field had no editor before this slice either); cloud email tz parity needs a per-tenant setting (recorded above).
- **ARCH-01 (new, found during the REP-04 cloud parity sweep 2026-08-31)** — POS terminals push offline_queue items to `/api/sync/push`, but the cloud stores them **store-and-forward with NO runtime drain into `sales`/`sale_lines`/`refunds`**: the cloud revenue tables are populated only by the `migrate_sqlite_to_pg` cutover tool and the REST `POST /api/v1/sales` path. Consequence: terminal sales and refunds never appear in cloud email reports — those reflect only cloud-owned (REST-created + cutover-copied) data. The approved "sync refunds to Postgres" premise for the netting slice was therefore WRONG as stated; slice 2 was honestly rescoped to cutover-copy coverage (refunds added to `DEFAULT_TABLES` + `tenant_id`/RLS/grants) + faithful query netting. **The drain gap is a separate architectural decision (who owns the write path, idempotency, tenant attribution of queued rows) — deliberately NOT silently fixed here.**
- Also: stale-request races, unbounded custom-report results, CSV escaping

## Currency (`04-currency-module.md` — PARTIALLY REMEDIATED)

**Status:** IPC fixed-point contract aligned; **settlement, command scoping, and remaining UX/validation findings require follow-up**.

Key open items:
- ~~**CUR-02** — PaymentModal displays converted currency but settles the base currency amount~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-30**: tender snapshot (base currency / base total / fixed-point rate) flows PaymentModal → `complete_sale*` args → `Sale` → SQLite (`20260821_tender_currency.sql`) and is now also persisted to the cloud (`pg::create_sale`, commit bc8bb29c — the PG INSERT had silently dropped all five tender/tip/service columns that `pg::get_sale` reads).
- ~~**CUR-04** — PaymentModal chooses the first matching rate without selecting the effective historical rate~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-31 (`3ff5db6f`)**: the session path already asks the backend for the latest rate effective as-of today (`get_latest_exchange_rate_scoped` → `effective_date <= as_of ORDER BY effective_date DESC` — correct); settlement itself is snapshot-based by design (tender stores the payment-time fixed-point rate, CUR-02). The residual was the no-session fallback: `list_exchange_rates` ordered only by pair, so `find()` could surface the oldest-inserted rate — now newest-effective-first within each pair (Red-first backfill test).
- ~~**CUR-05** — Exchange-rate input and effective-date validation is incomplete~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-30** (see Currency section: validators on both clients + UI gating + `type="date"`; registry entry was stale).
- ~~**CUR-06** — Default-currency command scope~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-30**, commit `aa1f831f` (backend scoping existed; `ExchangeRateScreen` was the un-migrated UI consumer — now routes through `*_scoped` APIs).
- ~~**CUR-10** — missing delete confirmation~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-30** (`ConfirmDialog` before delete, pinned by tests). **CUR-09/CUR-11** remain open (locale/theme gaps; bounded-rate API + e2e coverage).
- Currency exponent-aware settlement rounding and a lossless string/decimal IPC representation for values beyond JavaScript's safe integer range

---

## Staff (`06-staff-module.md` — PARTIALLY REMEDIATED)

**Status:** security-critical staff IPC paths closed; **residuals documented**.

Key residual items:
- **STAFF-13 (partially)** — Security-focused command tests and wiring tests cover session binding, two-store identity, role hierarchy, PIN rotation/invalidation, rate limits… (remaining coverage gaps documented in the deleted report)
- ~~Deactivate/Restore flow: … backend does not prevent self/last-owner deactivation~~ — **backend half VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-30** (registry stale): `enforce_role_assignment_policy` on BOTH clients' scoped commands blocks self-role change, self-deactivation (STAFF-10), and deactivate/demote of the last active Owner (STAFF-02), plus Owner-only promotion; legacy unscoped staff commands are hard-disabled. Branch-pinning tests added (`d45d1119`: each guard exercised in isolation with exact-message asserts — the pre-existing last-owner test was satisfied by either branch). ~~**Remaining (UI, open):** no confirmation dialog, no per-row pending state.~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-31**: deactivation requires a named `ConfirmDialog` (STAFF-10 comment in `StaffManagementScreen.tsx:591`), the dialog carries `loading={deactivating}` (busy state, cancel guarded mid-request), and reactivation is the only no-confirm path by design. STAFF-13 is now FULLY CLOSED (command tests both clients + UI flow). ~~**Coverage gap noted:** the tablet's duplicated policy copy has NO command-level tests~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-31 (`34e84fb4`)**: the tablet now carries the full branch-pinned set (7 command-level security tests incl. both exact-message branch pins); all passed first run — the duplicated policy was genuinely enforced, the gap was coverage only. The registry's claim that "tablet test infra lacks a scoped-state helper" was stale: the customers_tests pattern ports directly.

---

## Loading States (`23-loading-states.md` — AUDITED)

**Status:** **ALL CLOSED — verified fixed 2026-08-31** against current code; a dedicated guard test (`__tests__/loadingStateCompliance.test.tsx`) now enforces the patterns.

- ~~**LOAD-01** — Two separate Skeleton components~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: single canonical `frontend/shared/Skeleton.tsx`; `components/Skeleton.tsx` is a documented 9-line compatibility re-export so 40+ importers share one source of truth.
- ~~**LOAD-02** — Load failures silently become an empty screen~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: sampled failure paths (ShiftBar, StockCountDetail, KdsProductPickerModal, CustomerManagement) all surface localized error toasts or error states; compliance test guards the pattern.
- ~~**LOAD-03** — Demo-data fallbacks mask production failures~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: no demo-data path remains in any data-loading screen (analytics card states it explicitly); remaining "demo" hits are the intentional DesignSystem showcase pages.
- ~~**LOAD-04** — Initial-load vs refresh semantics (KdsScreen)~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: `KdsScreen` gates the skeleton on `initialLoading` only; refreshes update the live board in place.
- ~~**LOAD-05** — Progress not announced~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: shared `LoadingStatus` (role=status, localized label) wraps decorative skeletons; 11 screen usages + compliance test.

---

## Topology — Rust (`30-topology-rust.md` — ⚠️ 8 FINDINGS, OPEN)

**Status:** **ALL CLOSED — verified fixed 2026-08-31** (TOP-01→TOP-08).

- ~~**TOP-01** — Raw control bytes in test string literals~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: no control-byte literals remain; `topology_setting_key` now REJECTS control chars (dedicated tests: `..._control_chars_rejected`, `..._rejects_path_injection`).
- ~~**TOP-02** — Setting-key constant duplicated across three modules~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: single home in `topology/model.rs` (`TOPOLOGY_SETTING_KEY`, `TOPOLOGY_RUNTIME_SETTING_KEY`, `TOPOLOGY_APPLY_*`, `TOPOLOGY_SCHEMA_VERSION`), consumed via `pub(crate)`.
- ~~**TOP-03** — Duplicated paragraph in `load_topology_data` doc~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: doc is a single coherent explanation (load-side raw-port faithfulness + healing rationale), pinned by `load_topology_data_preserves_raw_legacy_null_ports`.
- ~~**TOP-04** — `save_topology_data` duplicated structural validation~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: save calls the shared `validate_topology_structure` (persistence.rs:726); the comment records the drifted inline copy's removal.
- ~~**TOP-05** — Legacy typed API production-dead~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: `save_topology_data`/`load_topology_data` are now `#[cfg(test)]`-gated test-compat helpers; production flows through `apply_topology_diff` only.
- ~~**TOP-06** — Missing doc comments~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: sampled items (`default_direction`, `topology_apply_request_key`, `persist_topology_recovery`) all carry doc comments.
- ~~**TOP-07** — O(n²) scans in validation core~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED**: membership checks use prebuilt sets (`workspace_id_set.contains`, `warehouse_ids` via set lookups).
- ~~**TOP-08** — File-size watch items~~ — **NO ACTION**: `persistence.rs` 786 lines (under the 1,000 cap); test files within the module's cited guideline. Watch item only.

## Money — Frontend (`32-money-frontend.md` — FULLY REMEDIATED)

**Status:** FRONTEND-01/02/03/04 all closed (04 found + fixed during the FRONTEND-03 sweep, 2026-08-30).

- **FRONTEND-01** — PaymentModal charge-amount row inflates by base exponent (P1, FIXED)
- **FRONTEND-02** — usePosState silently mixes currencies in the subtotal (P1, FIXED)
- ~~**FRONTEND-03** — IPC boundary drops line currency (P2, **DEFERRED to Phase 5 — open, needs backend change**)~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-30**, commit `fc8eae22`: `AddLineArgs.unit_price_currency` (optional, wire-compatible) added on desktop + tablet; commands build the line in the wire currency so `Cart::add_line`'s (previously dead) mismatch check rejects cross-currency lines; invalid ISO codes fail closed. PaymentModal sends `line.unit_price.currency` on both sale paths. Pinned by tablet e2e (EUR line into USD cart → Err) + desktop serde-shape/helper tests + UI contract tests. Follow-up also **CLOSED 2026-08-30**, commit `4439cfa3`: `CartLineData.unit_price_currency` in `complete_sale_with_resolved_shortfalls_scoped` (both clients) — same helper pattern, same fail-closed parse; PaymentModal's shortfall-dialog mapping sends the line currency, dialog passthrough pinned by test.
- ~~**FRONTEND-04** (P2, found 2026-08-30 during the FRONTEND-03 sweep) — multi-currency charge + stock shortfall settles the second command in the WRONG currency~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-30**, commit `0e5e8bf9`. Semantics decision: the retry must settle in the SAME currency the first command used (charge currency) — it is a retry of the same sale. Fix (UI-only; the Rust struct already accepted all five CUR-02 fields): CUR-02 tender metadata lifted into a shared `tenderSnapshot` memo used by the QRIS path, main path, and shortfall dialog; dialog now receives `lineItemsInCartCurrency` + `cartCurrency` + `effectiveTotalInCartCurrency` + `tenderedMinorInCartCurrency` and forwards tip/service/base fields into the retry args. Pinned by a multi-currency e2e (USD cart → IDR charge at 16500: retry payload currency IDR, converted line amounts, baseCurrency/baseTotalMinor/tenderRateMillionths) + single-currency tip/service pin (previously the retry recorded tip=0/service=0 even without multi-currency).

## Money — TDD sweep (`MONEY-01..05` — CLOSED 2026-08-31; residual LOYALTY-01 also CLOSED)

A `/tdd` pass over the money area (foundation `money.rs` came back exemplary — deep-audited, property-tested, no change needed; the weaknesses were all in the UI conversion/input edges and one daemon cast):

- ~~**MONEY-01** — PaymentModal tender conversion mis-rounded .5 boundaries~~ — **FIXED `79247c92`**: the conversion chain (`baseMinor/10^exp × float-rate × 10^exp`) turned exact decimal halves into float values slightly below the tie — brute-forced counterexamples: 0.03 USD @ 149.5 → 448 instead of 449, 0.41 → 6129 vs 6130. Replaced by `convertMinorUnits` (BigInt, half-up toward +∞, inverse-pair aware via an `inverted` flag) + `reciprocalMillionths` for the persisted `tender_rate_millionths` (the snapshot now carries the ORIGINAL integer, not a float round-trip). 11 unit tests.
- ~~**MONEY-02** — every user-entered money field parsed with `Math.round(parseFloat(s) × 10^scale)`~~ — **FIXED `89589dae`**: "1.005" USD → 100 cents (exact: 101); parseFloat also swallowed "1e3" → 1000 and "1,500" → 1 on free-text fields. `parseMinorUnits` (strict decimal regex + BigInt scaling + half-up) migrated to all sites: tender, split amounts (×3), rate editor (scale 6), shift balances, staff pay (garbage → absent, not NaN). 12 unit tests.
- ~~**MONEY-03** — rate-sync daemon cast untrusted API floats with saturating `as i64`~~ — **FIXED `6736fb02`**: a `1e300` response became `i64::MAX`, which PASSES the repo's `>0` validation and persists. `rate_to_millionths` now rejects non-finite/non-positive/≥1e10/sub-resolution before the cast; rejected rows warn+skip. 6 unit tests.
- ~~**MONEY-04** — Rp discount tab hardcoded ×100~~ — **FIXED `46fd1ab0`**: for IDR (exponent 0) the ratio inflated 100× — Rp 2,000 off Rp 100,000 computed pct=200 → `setDiscount` clamps → **100% off, free goods**. Now scales by `minorUnitExponent(subtotal.currency)`. Red test pinned first (the tab had zero coverage).
- ~~**MONEY-05** — shift open/close balances hardcoded ×100~~ — **FIXED `46fd1ab0`**: `opening_balance_minor` is store-currency minor units; every IDR drawer count was stored 100× inflated, breaking `expected_cash` reconciliation. Now scales by `minorUnitExponent(storeSettings.currency)`. The old test PINNED the bug (100000 → 10000000); corrected.
- ~~**LOYALTY-01 (OPEN)** — `db/loyalty.rs` computed `points = ((base as f64)/100 × earn_multiplier).round() as i64` with the multiplier stored as `REAL`~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-31**, commits `803f6239` (core) + `02b264cd` (UI): the multiplier is now **fixed-point millionths** end to end (`earn_multiplier_millionths INTEGER`, the repo's own `rate_millionths` precedent). Evidence that justified it: exhaustive scan (double vs exact-decimal, half-away) — multiplier 1.4 flipped at 585 bases ≤ 2,000,000, e.g. base=2250 (a $22.50 sale at points_per_unit=1): float 31.499999999999996 → 31 points where exact decimal gives 32, always DOWNWARD for 1.4; 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.5/1.75/2.0 never flipped in range (1.5/1.75/2.0 binary-exact; the others' error snaps back at the tie — which is why the seeded tiers 1.0/1.25/1.5/2.0 hid this for so long). The corruption was at WRITE time (UI JS number → f64 IPC → REAL column), so no compute-site patch could recover intent. Fix: migration `20260831_loyalty_multiplier_fixedpoint.sql` (drop triggers → ADD COLUMN → backfill `CAST(ROUND(old × 1e6) AS INTEGER)` → DROP COLUMN → recreate triggers; no table rebuild, the `loyalty_accounts.tier_id` FK is never disturbed), `compute_points()` exact i128 half-up toward +∞, DTO/wire rename to `earn_multiplier_millionths`, tier editor parses via `parseMinorUnits(x, 6)` and displays via `millionthsToDecimalString` (integer-only). Postgres intentionally untouched — the cloud has no loyalty code path and `init.pg.sql` is a generated artifact. 5 new Rust tests (boundary grid, extremes saturate, end-to-end $22.50→32, legacy backfill, seeded-tier exactness) + 3 UI tests (prefill "1.25", save 1_400_000, zero rejected).
- **Test hygiene fallout (CLOSED `0ffdd2c3`)** — the full-suite run surfaced 6 tests red at HEAD *before* the money batch: the scoped-IPC audit (`5e0d4caa`) and REP-06 shipped without updating RefundModal (wire object dropped `userId`; token is arg 0), VoidOrdersScreen (`voidSaleScoped` positional), a11yTransitions (StatusBar's scoped offline call), and AnalyticsScreen ×2 (category fixture missing the REP-06 row currency — `Intl.NumberFormat` currency-style throws on a missing code; CSV export predates the REP-06a currency column). The ERR-10 compliance whitelist pinned PaymentModal line numbers and drifted under MONEY-01/02 — now content-anchored with a per-entry sanity check.

## Currency — Exchange & Settlement (`34-currency-exchange.md` — MOSTLY REMEDIATED)

**Status:** CUR-02/03/04/05/06/08/10/11 closed; **CUR-09 remains open** (locale/theme gaps, low value). Design-recommendation leftovers also landed 2026-08-31: shortfall-receipt preview parity (`8f79bd43`) and CurrencyContext refresh + workspace bridge (`319f03dd`).

- ~~**CUR-02** (P0) — PaymentModal displays converted currency but settles the base currency amount (multi-currency settlement)~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-30** (see Currency section: local snapshot verified in code; cloud persistence gap in `pg::create_sale` fixed, commit bc8bb29c, pinned by the PG roundtrip test).
- ~~**CUR-05** (remaining) — exchange-rate input / effective-date validation residuals~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-30** (registry was stale): `validate_create_rate_args` on desktop AND tablet (shared by legacy + scoped paths) rejects non-positive rates, same-currency pairs, non-ISO-4217 codes, and malformed `YYYY-MM-DD` effective dates; UI side `ExchangeRateScreen` gates Save on the same conditions incl. the millionths conversion (exact `parseMinorUnits(form.rate, 6)` since MONEY-02), and the date field is `type="date"` (browser-enforced format). Pinned by `exchange_rates_tests.rs` (zero/negative, same-pair, non-ISO, malformed-date, valid-input).
- ~~**CUR-06** — default-currency command scope~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-30**, commit `aa1f831f`: backend scoped variants (`get/set_default_currency_scoped`, rate commands) already enforced `SETTINGS_READ`/`SETTINGS_EDIT` + store resolution with ISO validation on set; the residual was the UI — `ExchangeRateScreen` still called the legacy global-DB APIs for list/create/delete. Now routes through the `*_scoped` wrappers whenever a workspace session exists. Pinned by 3 new tests (token passthrough + legacy-not-called).
- ~~**CUR-10** — missing delete confirmation~~ — **VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-30**: `ExchangeRateScreen` renders a `ConfirmDialog` (`currency-delete-confirm`, danger variant) before `deleteExchangeRate`; pinned by the delete tests.
- **CUR-09** — locale/theme gaps (unverified; low value, left open)
- ~~**CUR-11** — bounded/latest-rate APIs + e2e coverage~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-31** (`8f026449` + `41598afa`): `CurrencyRepository::list_latest_exchange_rates` returns one row per pair (newest `effective_date`; `UNIQUE(pair, date)` makes ties impossible, `created_at`/`rowid` tail is defence in depth — `rowid`, not `id`, because rate ids are UUIDs), exposed as `list_latest_exchange_rates_scoped` on both clients behind `SETTINGS_READ`, and wired into the PaymentModal currency load (the picker needs current rates per pair, not the history; the rate editor keeps the full list). Playwright coverage added as a SCREEN-CONTRACT spec (route, columns, Save gating incl. same-pair rejection, CUR-10 delete-confirm) — the e2e run surfaced that **the exchange-rate commands have no cloud REST counterpart** (web/e2e mode serves them from the dev-mock; real CRUD is impossible there), an ARCH-01-family gap recorded rather than silently extended.
- ~~**ARCH-01-family: rate REST gap**~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-31** (`5b0f1662` + this batch): `crates/oz-api` gained the full rate surface mirroring the scoped IPC commands 1:1 — `GET /api/v1/exchange-rates` (CUR-04 order), `GET …/latest` (CUR-11), `GET …/latest/{from}/{to}` (case-insensitive), `POST …` (CUR-05 validation shared via `pg::validate_exchange_rate_request`), `DELETE …/{id}`. Dual-path like tax-rates: PG helpers in `pg.rs` (unique→409, FK→400) or SQLite fallback via `CurrencyRepository` with an explicit duplicate pre-check (the repo surfaces the constraint as a raw Db error). Rates are global reference data in the cloud schema (no `tenant_id`, no RLS — same treatment as categories). OpenAPI spec + protected-route assertions updated; 11 route tests + live-PG roundtrip + real-CRUD e2e (`api.spec.ts`, per-worker dates to survive parallel projects).
- **UUID-vs-rowid tiebreaker sweep — CLEAN 2026-08-31**: every other `ORDER BY … id` recency pattern was checked. `audit_log` (`created_at DESC, id DESC`) and `offline_queue` (`created_at ASC, id ASC`) are safe — both ids are UUID **v7** (time-ordered); `prune.rs` `ORDER BY id` is batch stability, not recency; `recipes`/PO-lines/transfer-lines `ORDER BY id` is listing order. `exchange_rates` was the only genuine trap (mixed id lineage possible) and it already pins `rowid` in SQLite / relies on `UNIQUE(pair, date)` in PG. No code change needed.
- **.env poison — HARDENED 2026-08-31**: six Paddle note-lines with spaces in keys (`PADDLE PROD IDS = …`) broke `docker compose` for the whole e2e stack with the terse `failed to read .env: line 21: key cannot contain a space` (the root `.env` is untracked — the poison was local-only, commented out on discovery). Hardened with `scripts/validate-env.mjs` — a quote-state-aware dotenv validator (handles the real multi-line PEM value without false positives) wired as a pre-flight in `run-e2e.mjs startDocker()`, so the next poisoned line fails fast with every offending line numbered instead of dying inside compose. `.env.example` verified clean.
- **Foreign breakage at HEAD — RESOLVED UPSTREAM + VERIFIED 2026-08-31**: the unused-`total` warning in tablet `pos.rs` (`192c5bc6`) and the nine red PaymentModal tests were fixed by the PROMO-3 owner's follow-up `100dcdef` mid-repair. Verified at the gate rather than assumed: fresh `cargo check` warning-free, `cargo clippy -p oz-pos-tablet -p oz-api --all-targets` clean, payment family 99/99 green.
- **Leftovers landed 2026-08-31 (design batch, not numbered findings):** shortfall-resolved sales now show the same receipt print preview as the normal path — `StockShortfallDialog` forwards the `CompleteSaleResult` and the modal builds items from the COMMITTED sale lines (resolutions change what sold; the local cart no longer does); `CurrencyProvider` gained `refresh(token?)` (scoped per-store default when a session exists, global bootstrap otherwise, errors keep the last good value) plus a `CurrencyWorkspaceSync` bridge below `WorkspaceProvider` in both entries — per-store defaults (CUR-03 commands) now reach `useCurrency` consumers without a page reload.

## Refund guards — `create_refund` (rust-auditor COR-25/COR-26 — CLOSED 2026-08-30)

- ~~**COR-25** (MEDIUM) — over-refund guard ran outside the transaction and read the cumulative refunded SUM with `.unwrap_or(0)`: a read error read as "zero refunds" and the money guard failed OPEN~~ — fixed: guard inside the tx, SUM errors propagate (`crates/oz-core/src/db/refunds.rs`, commit 8f01a5d0; regression test `over_refund_guard_fails_closed_when_cumulative_sum_unreadable`).
- ~~**COR-26** (LOW) — refund currency never compared to the sale currency~~ — fixed: `create_refund` rejects a mismatch with `CoreError::CurrencyMismatch` (commit a53feaea; regression test `create_refund_rejects_currency_mismatch`).

## PG integration harness — silently-skipped tests (CLOSED 2026-08-30)

`throwaway_test_pool` built DB names from UUID `Display` (hyphens) inside an
unquoted `CREATE DATABASE` identifier → server syntax error → every
throwaway-DB PG test (REST roundtrip, RLS non-owner, concurrent adjust,
sync-store) printed "skipped" and reported PASS — cloud money-path coverage
was silently zero. Fixed with `.simple()` hex names + probe connections
retargeted to the throwaway DB (commit a022b4fb). **Verified live: oz-api
198/198 and oz-cloud-server 224/224 with ZERO skips.** Residual risk: on
machines/CI without PG the skip is still quiet (PASS) by design.

## Topology — Editor UI (`31-topology-editor-ui.md` — ✅ ALL CLOSED 2026-08-26)

**Status:** **all 7 findings repaired in one commit** (TOP-UI-01→TOP-UI-07). Audit of
`ui/src/features/stores/` (33 production files, ~12k lines) + docs. No blocking
findings; verdict was "solid code, stale docs".

Closed items:
- **TOP-UI-01** — ADR #34 pairing table listed 8 rows; shared contract (`topologySemantics.json`,
  frontend + Rust `include_str!`) implements 7. `location-out → operation-in` removed from the
  ADR table with an explanatory note; parent ADR #34 §Slice 1 corrected to match.
- **TOP-UI-02** — ADR #34 audit stamp (09-08-26) predated 12-08-26 sections; new sections
  re-verified during this audit, stamp refreshed to 26-08-26.
- **TOP-UI-03** — ADR #34 cited `topologyCard.ts` as the pairing-table home and row order that
  drifted from the JSON; doc now references `topologySemantics.json` and matches row order.
- **TOP-UI-04** — `docs/api-reference.md` missing `can_save_topology` command; row added.
- **TOP-UI-05** — `topology.rs` module doc said "four #[tauri::command]" but only 3 exist
  (the 4th is a startup daemon); comment corrected to "three".
- **TOP-UI-06** — 4 pre-existing `topologyNodeCard.test.tsx` failures (validation text renders
  twice: tooltip + SR-only span; dismiss button hidden in the tooltip portal); tests now query
  `getAllByText` / `hidden: true`.
- **TOP-UI-07** — `docs/multi_pos_one_location_support.md` cited `topologyEditor.tsx`; actual
  file is `NodeTopologyEditor.tsx`; path corrected.

## How to close these

Each finding's original remediation guidance lives in git history under
`audit/<NN>-<slug>.md` (the file was consolidated into this document; the
per-finding fix descriptions, affected files, and commit lists remain
available via `git log` on the deleted path). Re-open a finding here, fix
it, then flip its status in this file.
