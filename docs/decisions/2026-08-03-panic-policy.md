## Context

RUST-07 (audit/25-rust-backend.md) found that panic-oriented APIs remained in
production startup/API paths: `oz_api::serve()` unwrapped DB open, pragma/WAL
setup, migration application, port binding, and the server loop, and numerous
`unwrap`/`expect` calls lived in production modules outside test contexts. A
bad path, unavailable port, migration failure, or malformed runtime value could
terminate an unattended desktop/cloud process without a structured error or
actionable recovery, obscuring the original failure from callers.

The remediation closed the startup boundary first (`oz_api::serve()` returns
`Result`, commit `d82b133d`) and then swept the remaining recoverable panics
into `Result`/fallback paths and introduced a workspace panic-inventory gate
(commit `6f7307b3`). This ADR records the policy that remediation established:
when a panic is an acceptable, documented invariant and when it is a defect that
must be a `Result`.

---

## Decision

Panic is a **fallback of last resort reserved for proven-impossible states**.
Every production `unwrap`/`expect` that is not a documented invariant is a
defect. The line between the two categories is defined below and enforced by
`scripts/scan-unwrap-panic.py` as an inventory gate wired into
`scripts/check.sh`.

### When a panic is acceptable

A panic is acceptable **only** when all three hold: the failure is provably
impossible at runtime, the reason is documented in a `// SAFETY:`/`// INVARIANT:`
comment on the same or immediately preceding line, and a reviewer can verify the
invariant. Concretely:

- **Compile-time constants & static initialization.** Static, immutable
  registration that cannot fail once compiled — e.g. static Prometheus metric
  registration (`oz-reporting`/`oz-cloud-server` `metrics.rs`) and the
  `OnceLock`-cached SQL-validation regexes in `oz-plugin/db.rs` (compiled from
  `const` pattern literals). Because the literals are compile-time constants,
  a malformed edit fails the new `sql_validation_regexes_compile` test under CI
  — never a live process. This collapsed 10 per-regex `.expect("invalid … regex")`
  sites into one unreachable helper.
- **Validated input.** An `unwrap`/`expect` on a value already validated by the
  same function is acceptable when the validation immediately precedes the
  unwrap and the `// SAFETY:` comment says so — e.g. `Percentage::new` calls on
  already-validated percentages in desktop/tablet `pos.rs`.
- **Poisoned locks.** A `Mutex`/`RwLock` poisoned only by an in-process panic in
  the same mock/driver (test doubles) may `expect` — the lock's poisoned state
  is itself the failure signal, and the data behind it is irrelevant in a mock.
  This is the one production-facing exception: **real** production lock poison
  must recover via `PoisonError::into_inner()` rather than panic
  (see the platform-startup rate-sync DB lock, converted in `6f7307b3`).
- **Convenience wrappers & setup that cannot fail by construction.**
  `LuaRuntime::default()`, `SyncTransport::new()` (a convenience wrapper over
  the fallible `try_new`), `oz-logging::init()` documented-panic wrappers, and
  in-memory `fresh_db()` ops are acceptable — each documents why the setup path
  is unconditional.

Test code is exempt by definition: `#[cfg(test)]`, `mod tests`, `#[test]`,
`*/tests/`, benches, and `test_helpers.rs` are excluded from the inventory.

### When it must be `Result`

Any failure whose possibility depends on runtime state — environment, I/O,
user input, network, filesystem, or lock state across threads — must propagate
as `Result`, with context attached via `thiserror`/`anyhow` at the application
edge. The RUST-07 residual converted 16 such sites:

- **Startup/command boundaries return `Result`:** `oz-api::serve()` and
  `oz-cloud-server` `main`/`serve` return
  `Result<(), Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>>` for logging init, DB init,
  in-memory SQLite, port bind, and server-loop failures.
- **String decoding:** `oz-cli` import-path currency decoding
  (`currency_to_utf8`) returns `anyhow` errors instead of `from_utf8().unwrap()`.
- **Post-commit lookups:** `oz-core` gift-card lookups use
  `ok_or_else(NotFound)` instead of `?.unwrap()`.
- **Optional/fallible infrastructure:** `shutdown_signal()` logs and falls back
  to `pending()` when signal-handler installation fails; the sync pagination
  cursor uses `last().map(...)` instead of `last().unwrap()`.
- **Lock poison in production:** platform-startup rate-sync DB locks recover
  via `unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())` rather than panicking on poison.

Rule of thumb: **if a human, a file, the network, or another thread can make it
fail, it is `Result`. If only a programming error can make it fail, it is a
documented invariant panic — or better, a test.**

### How `scripts/scan-unwrap-panic.py` enforces it

The script is a **grep-precise inventory** — it makes the policy auditable
rather than pretending textual analysis can prove invariants. It is
fail-closed only through the explicit `--fail-on-recoverable` gate: the
scanner never asserts that a tagged site is truly unreachable; it requires
the reviewer's `// SAFETY:` / `// INVARIANT:` comment to be present and
verifiable.

- **Scope:** scans `crates/`, `apps/`, `platform/`, `modules/` for `*.rs`.
- **Exclusions (test/dev contexts):** skips `*/tests/` dirs, `#[cfg(test)]`
  blocks, `mod tests`/`mod test` blocks, `#[test]`-annotated functions,
  `/benches/` harnesses, and `test_helpers.rs`.
- **Invariant tagging:** a `# SAFETY:`/`// INVARIANT:` (or `cannot fail` /
  `must not fail` / `impossible`) comment on the same or immediately preceding
  line marks a finding as `[INVARIANT]` — the documented-acceptable set.
- **Output:** `--json` emits `total`, `invariant_annotated`, `recoverable`, and
  per-file counts; plain mode prints every finding with its `[INVARIANT]` tag.
  `--fail-on-recoverable` prints a single summary line on success and the
  failing findings on failure (exit 1).
- **Gate (fail-closed):** `scripts/scan-unwrap-panic.py --fail-on-recoverable`
  exits 1 when any finding lacks a documented invariant comment; wired into
  both `scripts/check.sh` and the CI `rust-panic-inventory` job. The rule is
  now enforced mechanically: **the recoverable set (non-INVARIANT) must stay
  at zero**. Current production inventory: **98/98 documented invariants**, verified
  live on 2026-08-03 — down from 123 before remediation; the recoverable set
  is provably zero. New `unwrap`/`expect` in production code fails the gate
  unless it carries a verifiable invariant comment.

## Status

Implemented. Startup and command boundaries return `Result` (`d82b133d`); 16
recoverable panics converted to `Result`/fallback and the panic-inventory gate
added (`6f7307b3`); the residual production panic inventory is 98/98
documented invariants (from 123 before remediation; the recoverable set is
provably zero, verified live 2026-08-03). RUST-07 is closed as fully
remediated in audit/25-rust-backend.md.

**2026-08-03 — upgraded to a hard gate.** The gate is now fail-closed in both
`scripts/check.sh` and CI (`rust-panic-inventory` job in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `scripts/scan-unwrap-panic.py --fail-on-recoverable`
exits 1 when any finding lacks a documented invariant comment, so the
recoverable-set-at-zero rule is enforced mechanically, not by review.

Remaining ideas (deferred, not planned): a diff-scoped variant that scans only
files touched by a PR (`git diff --name-only`) for faster feedback, and a
tracked baseline JSON to chart inventory history over time.
