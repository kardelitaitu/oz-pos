# ADR #10: Sync Performance Strategy

**Status:** Implemented (all 3 phases complete as of 2026-07-15)

## Context

OZ-POS is designed to support low-end hardware (e.g., Android 9 tablets, Core2Duo PCs) operating in low-bandwidth, unstable, or offline environments.

Additionally, the project has a strict cost target: **the cloud sync server must cost no more than $2–$3 a month to host** (typically a tiny shared-core VPS with 512MB–1GB RAM and 1 shared vCPU), yet be capable of handling synchronization for thousands of active stores.

Currently:
- The client-side sync engine (`platform-sync`) retrieves all pending offline changes from the `offline_queue` SQLite table and sends them in a single massive HTTP request to the cloud sync server (`oz-cloud-server`). If a terminal has been offline for a long period, this causes OOM crashes, high CPU spikes, and request timeouts.
- The sync payload is currently sent uncompressed, consuming significant cellular or satellite data.
- High-frequency active polling by thousands of stores would easily overwhelm a low-tier $2 VPS with connection overhead and concurrent database queries.

## Strategy

This ADR sets the overall direction. The implementation is split into 3 independent phases, each with its own spec, acceptance criteria, and ship timeline:

| Phase | Spec | Focus | Est. effort |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | `docs/specs/_active/p1-sync-batching-compression-retention.md` | Client-side batching (64 KB), Gzip compression, 90-day retention, `AnchorExpired` (410 Gone), cursor-based pruning | 2-3 weeks | ✅ **DONE** (2026-07-15) |
| **2** | `docs/specs/_active/p2-sync-priority-concurrency.md` | Sync priority tiers (`SyncPriority`), per-route-group concurrency limits, 2-thread Tokio runtime | 1-2 weeks | ✅ **DONE** (2026-07-15) |
| **3** | `docs/specs/_active/p3-sync-pagination-snapshot-observability.md` | Pull pagination, snapshot endpoint + cache + recovery, tiered heartbeat, Prometheus metrics, health endpoint, structured logging | 2-3 weeks | ✅ **DONE** (2026-07-15) |

### Implementation summary

- **P-1** (12 commits): 64 KB batch splitting (`build_batches`), gzip via `reqwest`, `MAX_BATCH_BYTES`, 90-day retention with cursor-based `DELETE LIMIT 1000`, `AnchorExpired` error type, prune loop in `oz-cloud-server`.
- **P-2** (7 commits): `SyncPriority` enum (`Critical=0, Normal=1, Low=2`), `priority` column (migration 073), `enqueue_offline_priority`, priority-sorted `build_batches`, `ConcurrencyLimitLayer` (API=10, sync=40), `worker_threads=2`.
- **P-3** (12 commits): Cursor-based pull pagination (`created_at|id`, LIMIT 501/500), `GET /api/sync/snapshot` with 5-min in-memory cache, `AnchorExpired` → snapshot recovery + `import_snapshot`, tiered heartbeat in status response, Prometheus `/metrics` (6 metrics), `GET /health`, structured logging per sync cycle.

**Total: 31 commits across all 3 phases.**

### Rationale for phasing

- **Phase 1** removes the immediate OOM risk and bandwidth cost. It is the highest-ROI change and can ship standalone.
- **Phase 2** improves fairness and resource isolation, but only matters under load that Phase 1 may already mitigate.
- **Phase 3** addresses edge cases (90-day offline terminals, large-scale observability) that are speculative until real usage data is available.

All phases are backward-compatible with existing clients. The server accepts both legacy (flat array) and batched (array-of-arrays) push formats. Clients can be upgraded independently.

## Sizing & Target Cost

| Workspace Count | Min SSD (90-day) | CPU | RAM | Monthly Cost |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 100 | 30 GB | 1 core | 1-2 GB | $2.50 – $4.00 |
| 500 | 100 GB | 1-2 cores | 2 GB | $6.00 – $10.00 |
| 2,000 | 375 GB | 2 cores | 4 GB | $15.00 – $25.00 |

Target: **100 tenants @ ≤$4/mo**. The $2-$3 VPS constraint applies only to the sub-500-tenant tier.
