# ADR #35: RBAC — Role Assignments with Branch/Workspace Scopes and User Profile Data

Date: 2026-08-11

Status: Accepted (design ratified in [`roles.md`](../../roles.md); implementation sequenced there in §10)

## Context

Today the system has six roles — `role-owner`, `role-manager`, `role-cashier`,
`role-kitchen`, `role-staff`, `role-custom` — stored in a single `roles` table
with a JSON `permissions` column, and users carry one global `role_id`
(`users` table, migration `007_customers.sql`). Enforcement is per-command
`require_permission_for_user(...)` against the global identity DB. Family
wildcard matching already exists in `rbac.rs::has_permission` (e.g. `"sales:*"`,
`"*"`), and module manifests (`modules/*/manifest.json`) already declare
per-module permission lists.

The current model cannot answer five questions that growth keeps raising:

1. **Stability.** Roles are enumerated flat lists. Adding a feature means
   editing every role that should have it — the opposite of a small, stable role
   set.
2. **Scopes.** A user's role is global. Multi-branch and multi-workspace
   assignments, explicit "all" semantics, and expiry are impossible.
3. **Sensitivity.** Nothing separates operational capabilities from irreversible
   or financial ones, so a future `sales:refund`-class key would be as
   wildcard-eligible as `reports:view`.
4. **User profile.** The `users` table has only username, display name, PIN
   hash, and role. There is no identity, payroll, or emergency-contact data, and
   no rule for what is mandatory, sensitive, or collectible at all.
5. **Read-only visibility.** There is no Auditor role; read-only "roles" are
   expressed as UI gating in places — and rounds 172/174 demonstrated that
   frontend gating is not a security boundary.

This ADR records the decisions; the full plan, data model, and implementation
sequence live in `roles.md` (ratified 2026-08-11).

## Decision

### D1 — Permission-first, role-light

Authorization is expressed through permission keys, never hard-coded role names.
Today's `{resource}:{action}` strings (underscore actions: `sales:process`,
`customers:view`, `kds:update`) are ratified and **never renamed for style** —
renames churn every enforcement call site for zero user value. Dotted suffixes
are allowed for new nested capabilities (e.g. `sales:discount.approve`).

### D2 — Family grants (operational) + explicit grants (sensitive)

- Roles grant at **family granularity** for operational capabilities
  (`sales:*`, `reports:*`, `customers:*`). A new key inside an existing
  operational family is automatically granted to every wildcard holder — zero
  role edits. Wildcard matching already exists in `rbac.rs`; the work is
  classification, not a new engine.
- Irreversible or financial capabilities — voids, refunds, billing, ownership
  transfer, role management, bulk export, staff identity/payroll/notes — are
  **never wildcarded**. Each sensitive key is enumerated explicitly on the roles
  that deserve it; that one grant line per role is the deliberate cost of
  preventing privilege creep.

### D3 — Code-resident permission registry, centralized fail-closed gate

- The registry (`key → family, sensitive, description`) lives in **code** —
  `rbac.rs` permission consts plus module manifests — not a database table, so
  it cannot be tampered with via a DB edit and authorization fails closed at
  compile time. Role grants (DB rows) are validated against the registry at
  write time.
- Enforcement is centralized in one backend `require_permission(permission)`
  gate that every permission-sensitive command must pass, deny-by-default.
  The frontend only hides or disables unavailable UI. This replaces today's
  per-command `require_permission_for_user` pattern.

### D4 — Role taxonomy: five system roles, cashier/kitchen are not roles

- **Owner** — global scope, cannot be narrowed; everything including billing and
  ownership.
- **Admin** — global scope, cannot be narrowed (same mechanism as Owner);
  everything except ownership transfer, billing, and irreversible org actions by
  default.
- **Manager** — scoped to assigned branches and workspaces; operational
  management within scope.
- **Staff** — the single operational role, scoped to assigned branches and
  workspaces. **Cashier and kitchen are not roles**: a staff user assigned to
  `retail-pos` is the cashier-like operator, one assigned to `kds` is the
  kitchen-like operator. The username (`cashier-1`) and the optional `job_title`
  field are human labels only — the backend never authorizes from names.
- **Auditor** — global, read-only; implemented as a permission set, never a
  frontend flag; **never sees sensitive profile fields** (national ID, payroll,
  notes, emergency contact).

`role-staff` survives; `role-cashier`/`role-kitchen` are retired via the
assignment migration (D5) with behavior preserved by mapping them to Staff plus
the corresponding workspace scope. Custom roles are supported without schema
changes. **Role inheritance is permanently out of scope**: flat roles with
family grants are easier to reason about and audit, and hierarchies are what
force role edits as the system grows.

### D5 — Assignment model with explicit-all scopes

- `assignments` (`user_id`, `role_id`, `scope_mode` `global` | `scoped`,
  `expires_at` deferred), `assignment_branches`, `assignment_workspaces`.
- Global mode = org-level roles (Owner, Admin, Auditor); scope is ignored.
  Scoped mode carries a branch dimension and a workspace dimension, each
  independently an explicit `all` or a list — "all branches, only `retail-pos`"
  is expressible, and empty lists never mean "all".
- `users.role_id` migrates to a **default global-mode assignment** so existing
  databases are unchanged in behavior.
- Roles, assignments, and user profiles stay in the **global identity DB**;
  store data remains in per-store DBs (ADR #4). The store the session resolves
  to remains the enforcement boundary for store-scoped data.

### D6 — User profile data contract

- **Mandatory at creation (9):** username, full name, date of birth, phone,
  `national_id_type` + `national_id` (the "SSN or KTP if Indonesian"
  discriminator; per-type validation — SSN 9 digits, NIK 16; `national_id`
  UNIQUE when present as the duplicate-enrollment detector), email (UNIQUE,
  login identifier for management roles + invitation target), monthly take-home
  pay (i64 minor units, store currency, strictly positive), emergency contact
  name, emergency contact phone.
- Columns are **nullable in SQL**; "mandatory" is enforced at creation with
  field-specific errors. Existing rows are not forced to fabricate values — a
  user with missing required data is in an **incomplete-profile state**:
  checkout login works, the user is flagged in staff management, and
  management-role assignment plus sensitive-field grants require a complete
  profile.
- **Optional:** `job_title` (presentation only), `notes` (free text,
  `TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` like `customers.notes`), `address`, `language`,
  `avatar` (deferrable), `tax_id` (NPWP), `national_id_expires_at`,
  `emergency_contact_relationship`, `hire_date`.
- **Deliberately not collected:** gender, religion, marital status, ethnicity,
  blood type (zero authorization value, legally/ethically sensitive); bank
  account until direct deposit is a real feature; shift/availability belongs to
  a scheduling feature.
- **Sensitivity:** `national_id`, DOB, monthly pay, `tax_id` require the
  explicit `staff:read_identity` / `staff:read_payroll` grants — never family
  wildcards, never Auditor. `notes` reads ride `staff:read`, edit requires the
  explicit `staff:edit_notes`. `national_id` and monthly pay are **encrypted at
  rest via `oz-security`** (keyring-backed), consistent with the license-API-key
  encryption precedent. Emergency contact data is third-party PII: out of
  Auditor scope and out of exports by default.
- **Read audit and masking:** every read of `national_id`, monthly pay, or
  `tax_id` is an auditable event (key, user, timestamp) — the explicit grants
  give each sensitive field exactly one read path, so the audit is cheap.
  `national_id` is displayed as last-4 by default (`oz-security::mask`, the
  PAN-masking precedent); the full value requires the explicit grant and is
  masked in every other surface (audit, export, logs).
- **Data residency:** sensitive profile fields (`national_id`,
  `monthly_take_home_minor`, `tax_id`, emergency contact, `notes`) are
  **excluded from cloud sync and bulk exports by default** — the store-first
  model keeps them on the device; any future inclusion is a separate,
  explicitly-audited decision.
- **Login semantics:** username + PIN remain the checkout credential (today's
  argon2 PIN flow). Email is a unique *identifier*, not a second PIN/password
  credential in phase 1.
- **Retention:** deactivation does not delete identity, payroll, or emergency
  contact data — local labor/tax law typically requires payroll records kept for
  years, so retention is the compliance default; deletion is an explicit
  compliance decision, never automatic.
- **Storage:** sensitive columns stay on `users` with app-level gating + field
  encryption — a separate `user_profiles` table (or encrypted column family) is
  the future path if storage-level access control is ever needed.

### D7 — Deferred (explicitly)

Organization/tenant layer (`org_id`, invitations), permission caching, and
assignment expiry are deferred until multi-tenant deployment or scale demands
them. Invitations and org-scoped tables are deliberately not built yet.

### D8 — Related future work: staff analytics

A staff analytics page (shift and activity review for Owner/Admin/Manager) is a
planned follow-up. Its prerequisites are established here: the profile data
(D6), the assignment model (D5), the existing shift tables, and the audit trail
of permission-sensitive actions. Access is gated by the `staff:*` and
`reports:*` registry keys from D2/D3 — including the sensitive sub-keys, so
payroll fields never leak into a shift review by default. The read-audit and
data-residency rules from D6 carry into the analytics surfaces: sensitive
fields stay masked and on-device, and every access is traceable.

## Consequences

- Growing the system means growing the permission registry, **never editing
  roles** — validated by the acceptance test: a brand-new workspace must ship
  end-to-end (registry, grants, enforcement) with zero edits to existing role
  definitions.
- Multi-branch and multi-workspace assignments become possible; cashier/kitchen
  semantics are preserved as Staff + workspace scope, and job flavor moves to
  the username/`job_title` label instead of the authorization path.
- Sensitive PII gets explicit grants, at-rest encryption, and Auditor exclusion
  instead of riding a wildcard.
- Sensitive profile data stays on the device: excluded from cloud sync and bulk
  exports, masked in display, and read-audited — the store-first boundary (ADR
  #4) now protects HR data, not just transactions.
- Existing databases upgrade without behavior change (default global-mode
  assignment; nullable profile columns; `role-staff` survives).

## Tradeoffs / risks

- **Retiring `role-cashier`/`role-kitchen` is a breaking change** for seeded
  DBs. Mitigation: the migration maps them to Staff + the workspace scope their
  current permission set implies, so behavior is unchanged; the retire step is
  sequenced after the assignment migration.
- **Code-resident registry** means adding a key requires a release, not a config
  edit. That is the point (fail-closed at compile time), but it rules out
  runtime-added keys by design.
- **Admin is global-mode** like Owner. Orgs that want a branch-limited admin
  must use a custom scoped role or wait; recorded as a deliberate
  simplification, not an oversight.
- **National ID is mandatory** wherever the type list covers the jurisdiction.
  Jurisdictions outside US/Indonesia need a type addition before onboarding
  (NRIC, TFN, …) — the per-country growth path is explicit.
- **Payroll/identity data in the identity DB** is acceptable for the store-first
  model but raises the DB's sensitivity; field-level encryption via `oz-security`
  is the mitigation, with full SQLCipher at rest remaining an open spec (C-5).
  Read-audit and last-4 masking (D6) mitigate the display and query channels;
  retention defaults to compliance retention, never auto-delete.

## Verification

Implementation is sequenced in `roles.md` §10 and each step ships with focused
tests: role permissions, family wildcards, sensitive exclusions, branch scopes,
workspace scopes, high-risk actions, profile field validation, sensitive-field
read audit, masking, residency (sync/export exclusion), and migration
round-trips (default assignment, role retirement, incomplete-profile state). The registry/gate work replaces the per-command
`require_permission_for_user` call sites from rounds 172–174, whose tests stay
green as the migration contract.
