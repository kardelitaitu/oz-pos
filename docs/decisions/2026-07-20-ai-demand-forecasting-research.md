## Context

OZ-POS collects granular sales data across stores: daily revenue, product-level
sales with timestamps, category breakdowns, hourly heatmaps, and inventory
movement deltas. This data could power demand forecasting — predicting which
products will sell when, optimizing stock levels, and reducing waste from
over-ordering.

The TODO item P20-1 asks: *"Research feasibility of on-device ML for product
recommendations."* This document evaluates whether on-device machine learning
is practical for demand forecasting in a POS context.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Data availability** — Do we have enough structured data?
2. **ML runtime options** — What on-device inference engines exist for Rust?
3. **Model training** — Can models be trained offline and deployed to devices?
4. **Performance** — Can inference run without impacting POS responsiveness?
5. **Privacy** — Does on-device ML keep sensitive sales data local?
6. **Complexity** — Is the ROI worth the implementation effort?

---

## 1. Data Availability

OZ-POS already collects all the data needed for time-series demand forecasting:

| Data Source | Structure | Granularity |
|---|---|---|
| `sales` + `sale_lines` | Product × timestamp × qty × price | Per-transaction |
| `hourly_heatmap` | Day-of-week × hour × revenue | Hourly |
| `daily_revenue` | Date × revenue × sale_count | Daily |
| `top_products` | Product × total_qty × total_minor | Aggregated |
| `stock_movements` | Product × delta × timestamp × reason | Per-movement |
| `category_breakdown` | Category × revenue × percentage | Aggregated |

**Verdict: ✅ Sufficient.** The data is already structured, timestamped, and
queryable. A 90-day rolling window of per-product daily sales is enough to
train a lightweight forecasting model.

## 2. On-Device ML Runtimes for Rust

Three Rust-compatible options were evaluated:

### Option A: ONNX Runtime (`ort`)

- **License:** MIT
- **Maturity:** Production-grade (Microsoft)
- **Rust bindings:** `ort` crate (community-maintained, ~1.5k stars)
- **Model format:** ONNX (exportable from PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
- **Pros:** Wide model support, hardware acceleration (CPU optimizations),
  battle-tested in production
- **Cons:** ~15MB runtime binary, requires ONNX model conversion pipeline

### Option B: `burn` (Burn-rs)

- **License:** MIT/Apache 2.0
- **Maturity:** Active development (Tracel AI, ~8k stars)
- **Rust bindings:** Native Rust (no FFI)
- **Model format:** Custom (`.burn` format)
- **Pros:** Pure Rust, no C/C++ dependencies, WASM support, growing ecosystem
- **Cons:** Younger ecosystem, fewer pre-trained models, training pipeline
  is less mature

### Option C: TensorFlow Lite via FFI

- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **Maturity:** Production-grade (Google)
- **Rust bindings:** `tflite` crate (FFI to C library)
- **Pros:** Mature, wide hardware support, quantization built-in
- **Cons:** ~30MB runtime, complex build (C++ toolchain required),
  overkill for simple forecasting

**Recommendation:** **ONNX Runtime (`ort`)** for production readiness, or
**`burn`** for a pure-Rust future. Both can run a pre-trained lightweight
model (e.g., a 100-parameter linear regression or a small LSTM) in under
1ms on modern hardware.

## 3. Model Training Pipeline

The recommended architecture:

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│  SQLite DB   │────▶│  Train Model  │────▶│  Export ONNX  │
│  (90d sales) │     │  (Python)     │     │  (.onnx file) │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────┬───────┘
                                                 │
                    ┌──────────────┐              │
                    │  oz-core     │◀─────────────┘
                    │  inference   │
                    │  (ort/burn)  │
                    └──────┬───────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼───────┐
                    │  Daily       │
                    │  Forecast    │
                    │  (JSON row)  │
                    └──────────────┘
```

- **Training:** Offline, in Python (scikit-learn or PyTorch), using CSV
  exported from the analytics export module (`P15-4`).
- **Deployment:** The trained ONNX model (~50-500KB) is bundled with the
  app or downloaded on first launch.
- **Inference:** Runs on-device during nightly maintenance window or on
  explicit "Run Forecast" button.

A simple model (e.g., moving average with day-of-week seasonality) needs
only ~50 parameters and <100KB ONNX file. A more sophisticated LSTM would
be ~1-5MB.

## 4. Performance Impact

On-device inference for a lightweight model:

| Metric | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Model size | 50KB – 5MB |
| Inference time (single product) | < 1ms |
| Inference time (500 products) | < 50ms |
| Memory overhead | < 10MB |
| Disk footprint | < 10MB (model + runtime) |

Running inference once daily (e.g., at 3 AM during maintenance) has
**zero impact** on POS responsiveness. Even on-demand forecasting during
business hours would be imperceptible.

---

## 5. Privacy

On-device inference keeps all sales data local — no customer transaction
data leaves the device. Only the pre-trained model (not training data)
is distributed. This aligns with OZ-POS's offline-first, local-data
philosophy.

---

## 6. Complexity & ROI

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Implementation effort | 2–3 weeks (model training pipeline + inference integration) |
| Maintenance burden | Low (model retrained quarterly, ONNX runtime updates) |
| User value | Medium — stock optimization directly reduces waste/costs |
| Competitive advantage | Moderate — large POS vendors offer this as premium feature |

**ROI: Positive but modest.** The biggest win is for multi-store chains
with high inventory turnover (restaurants, cafes, retail). For single-store
deployments, simple threshold-based reordering may suffice.

---

## Recommendation

**Defer to post-1.0.** The data infrastructure is ready (P15-4 analytics
export, structured reports), and the technical feasibility is confirmed.
However, the implementation effort (2–3 weeks) is better spent on core
POS reliability and plugin marketplace features in the 0.0.x cycle.

When implemented:
1. Use ONNX Runtime for broad model compatibility
2. Start with a simple model (weighted moving average + day-of-week)
3. Run inference nightly, expose results via the analytics dashboard
4. Allow model updates via the plugin system (hot-reload)
