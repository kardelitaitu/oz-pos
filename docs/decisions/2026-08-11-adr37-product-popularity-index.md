# ADR #37: Product Popularity Index — Weighted Activity Score for Retail Sorting

Date: 2026-08-11

Status: Implemented (2026-08-12)

## Context

The retail POS product grid (ADR #36) needs a **popularity sort**: order
products by how popular they are, so the items customers actually want surface
first. The product owner requested a score driven by three signals: **sold**,
**searched**, and **edited**. The agreed scope is the full V2 design — all
three signals blended — not a sales-only v1.

Current state of each signal:

1. **Sold** — durable history already exists. `sale_lines` (sku, qty) joined to
   `sales` (`status = 'completed'`, created_at) is the authoritative record,
   and `query_top_products` in `crates/oz-reporting/src/daily_summary.rs`
   (plus `Store::top_products` in `db/reports.rs`) already aggregates it. No
   new write path needed for the dominant signal — including historical
   backfill.
2. **Searched** — nothing exists. Retail search is client-side filtering
   (`RetailPosScreen.tsx` searchQuery, `ProductLookupScreen.tsx`), so a search
   that results in a sale currently leaves no trace. Tracking requires a new
   event ledger and a light IPC write.
3. **Edited** — nothing per-product. The audit log (`010_audit_log.sql`) is a
   generic trail, not a counter. ADR #36 D5 wires the retail edit modal to
   `update_product_scoped`, which gives a natural hook for an edit event.

Two design hazards drive the formula:

- **Recency.** "Popularity" must mean *recent* popularity. A product that sold
  1,000 units six months ago and nothing since should not rule the sort.
- **Small catalogs.** A product with two sales must not outrank a steady
  1,000-sale seller. Any raw counter is full of flukes at retail catalog
  scale; the score needs Bayesian-style smoothing toward the catalog mean.

## Decision

### D1 — Score formula: decayed, smoothed, weighted

```
score = 0.6·Sales′ + 0.3·Search′ + 0.1·Edits′
```

Each raw component is a **recency-decayed event count** over a 90-day window:

```
raw_c = Σ_t events(t) × λ^t        t = days ago, λ = 0.93, window = 90 days
```

- **Sales raw** = units sold per day (`sale_lines.qty`, completed sales only).
- **Search raw** = acted-upon searches per day (search → product added to cart).
- **Edits raw** = product edit events per day.

Each component is then **Bayesian-smoothed** toward the catalog mean (the
IMDb weighted-rating approach):

```
c′ = (mean_c × m + raw_c × v) / (m + v)     v = contributing event count, m = 5
```

- **Decay (λ = 0.93/day)** gives ≈ 2 weeks of effective memory
  (1/(1−λ) ≈ 14 days) inside a 90-day hard window, with no window cliff — a
  product fades out smoothly instead of vanishing when it exits a flat
  window. At the window edge λ^90 ≈ 0.0015, so truncation loses nothing.
- **Smoothing (m = 5)** shrinks low-evidence scores toward the catalog mean, so
  a 2-sale fluke ranks mid-catalog, not #1, until it earns its place. This is
  the single most important property for a small catalog.
- **Weights 60/30/10** reflect signal confidence. Sales is the correct dominant
  signal; search is strong but noisier (raw search counts are polluted by typos
  and "we don't carry it" lookups, which is why only acted-upon searches count);
  edits are *operational attention*, not customer popularity, and are
  deliberately capped at 10% so data cleanup cannot distort the sort.

### D2 — Signal sources

- **Sales**: read from `sale_lines` — it is already the durable, synced ledger.
  No new sale-event rows; a single-SKU recompute re-aggregates the product's
  `sale_lines` directly. Backfill is free from existing history.
- **Search**: new `product_activity` rows with `event_type = 'search'`,
  emitted only when a product is added to the cart from a **non-empty search**
  (the `RetailPosScreen` search flow and the `ProductLookupScreen` Stock
  Inquiry sub-view). Search events fire through a new fire-and-forget command
  (D3).
- **Edits**: `product_activity` rows with `event_type = 'edit'`, emitted by the
  retail product-update path (ADR #36 D5 `update_product_scoped`) in the same
  transaction.

### D3 — Storage, computation, and IPC

One migration, `133_product_activity.sql` (registered in the `ALL` array,
unique prefix after 132):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS product_activity (
    id         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    sku        TEXT NOT NULL,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (event_type IN ('search', 'edit')),
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ', 'now'))
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_product_activity_sku ON product_activity(sku);

ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN popularity_score REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

- The ledger keeps **history**, the column keeps the **materialized score**:
  history lets the formula be retuned later without a migration; the column
  makes sorting O(1) and rides through the existing PERF-08 catalog cache in
  `ProductDto`.
- **`popularity.rs`** in `crates/oz-core` (not `crates/oz-reporting` as
  originally scoped): `src/popularity.rs` holds the pure, unit-tested function
  `compute_score(units_by_day, searches_by_day, edits_by_day, catalog_mean)
  -> f64` implementing D1, and `db/popularity.rs` holds the store-layer
  recompute/ledger access. The formula sits beside the code that writes scores
  (sale completion, search/edit recording, full-catalog backfill pass) rather
  than beside the reporting queries.
- **Recompute strategy:** single-SKU recompute after each contributing event —
  sale completion (for the sold SKUs), search record, edit record — plus a
  full-catalog backfill pass on first run and a repair command. Reads are
  always O(1) per product; writes are a ledger row plus a single-row UPDATE.
- **New IPC:** `record_product_search_scoped(sessionToken, sku)` in both
  clients (registered in `lib.rs`) — fire-and-forget, no return payload, must
  never block or fail the add-to-cart it accompanies. Edit events ride
  `update_product_scoped` (no new command).

### D4 — Local-only (never synced)

`popularity_score` and `product_activity` are **excluded from cloud sync**.
Popularity is a per-store sort aid: each store recomputes its sales component
from its own local `sale_lines`, and search/edit events are local actions. The
sync surface (ADR #36 D2 touched `SnapshotProduct`) is untouched by this ADR,
consistent with the cost-residency philosophy — popularity is derived, local,
and cheap to recompute, so it has no business on the wire. The sync product
upsert imports only its snapshot columns, so `popularity_score` and
`product_activity` rows are never transferred or overwritten by a pull.

### D5 — Sort integration

- The retail grid `SortField` union gains **`'popularity'`**.
  **The default sort on load is popularity descending** (most popular first),
  with SKU as the tiebreak (deterministic order for equal scores).
- The existing click-to-sort header behavior is unchanged: clicking any
  sortable column header (SKU, Stock, Name, Price) switches the sort to that
  column and toggles its direction on repeat clicks. **Popularity is itself a
  sortable option in the same control** — first click sorts descending (most
  popular first, the natural direction), repeat click flips to ascending — so
  the operator can leave and return to popularity at any time.
- `ProductDto` carries `popularity_score`; the sort is applied client-side on
  the cached catalog (PERF-08), matching how the existing sort fields work.
- A cosmetic 🔥 badge for the top-N popular products is optional and deferred
  (D6).

### D6 — Explicitly deferred

- Breadth weighting (`× ln(1 + distinct transactions)`) — optional refinement
  that rewards reach over one-customer bulk; the ledger can support it later.
- Per-category popularity — ✅ implemented (2026-08-12): the full pass now
  caches per-category smoothing means (`popularity.category_means`) and
  scores each product against its own category, so the grid's popularity sort
  is fair within a selected category; uncategorized products fall back to the
  global mean. The per-category evolution (2026-08-12) then surfaced those
  standings as a first-class report: `Store::category_popularity` in
  `crates/oz-core/src/db/popularity.rs` returns every category's product
  count, mean score, ratio to the catalog average, and top-N products ranked
  by score with category-relative rank + percentile, exposed as
  `get_category_popularity_scoped` in both clients and rendered as the
  Category Popularity card on the sales report. Per-period popularity and the
  demand-forecasting integration remain out of scope.
- Surfacing the score in analytics exports — the data will be available to the
  analytics tool through the local store DB (same path as cost, ADR #36 D2).

## Consequences

- The retail grid sorts by meaningful recent popularity from day one: the
  sales component is backfilled from existing `sale_lines`, while search/edit
  accumulate from zero.
- New products get a fair cold start — Bayesian smoothing places them mid-
  catalog rather than bottom (or a fluky top).
- Small footprint: one ledger row per search/edit, one single-row score
  recompute per event, O(1) sort reads. No sync surface change.
- Edits cannot distort the ranking (10% weight, smoothed).

## Tradeoffs / risks

- **Search IPC is a per-add round trip.** Mitigation: fire-and-forget with
  errors logged, never surfaced, and never awaited before the cart update; the
  offline queue is not involved (a dropped event costs one popularity tick).
- **Decay, window, and weights are opinions.** Mitigation: the ledgers preserve
  history, so retuning is a formula change in `popularity.rs`, not a migration.
- **Materialized score can go stale** if a recompute path is missed. Mitigation:
  exhaustive recompute hooks (sale completion, search, edit, backfill) plus a
  staleness test that exercises each hook.
- **Deleted products lose popularity history** (the same caveat already
  documented for `top_products` in audit/03 REP-05 — deleting a product
  erases its historical sales from product-level aggregates). Accepted —
  popularity is a live-sort aid, not an archival report.

## Verification

- `popularity.rs`: unit tests for decay math (λ, window edge), Bayesian
  smoothing (low-evidence shrink toward mean, m boundary), weight blend, empty
  catalog, single-event catalog.
- Migration: `product_activity` table + `popularity_score` column exist;
  registry/filesystem parity and monotonic-prefix tests stay green.
- Commands: `record_product_search_scoped` writes a ledger row (scoped auth);
  `update_product_scoped` writes an edit row in the same transaction;
  `complete_sale` recomputes the sold SKUs' scores; backfill command produces
  expected scores from seeded `sale_lines`.
- UI: grid defaults to popularity sort, tiebreaks on SKU, `ProductDto`
  carries `popularity_score`; add-from-search fires the event (mocked IPC,
  non-blocking); i18n key for the sort option in both bundles.
- The single verification pass from ADR #36 covers the combined change.

## Implementation Status

**Implemented (2026-08-12).** D1–D5 shipped, including the day-one backfill:
the full-catalog recompute pass is wired at store open
(`recompute_all_popularity` in both client apps) and migration 134 seeds edit
history from product timestamps, so the default popularity sort is meaningful
on first launch. Key commits: `e5cab0a9`, `2913d49c`, `be37eac1`
(implementation), `33b44571` (backfill), `9c8bc6cd` (ADR location
correction). Note the formula landed in `crates/oz-core/src/popularity.rs`
with the recompute/ledger access in `crates/oz-core/src/db/popularity.rs`, not
`crates/oz-reporting` as originally scoped — the score is written by the
store layer, so the formula sits beside that code. D6 deferrals (breadth
weighting, per-category/per-period popularity, analytics export) remain open.
