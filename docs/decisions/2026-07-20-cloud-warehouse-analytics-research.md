# ADR: Cloud Warehouse Analytics Export

**Status:** Research (Recommended: Defer to post-1.0)

## Context

The ROADMAP Phase 5 calls for "Analytics export to cloud warehouse (BigQuery / Snowflake)." OZ-POS already has:
- `AnalyticsBundle` (P15-4) — 8 structured report types bundled as JSON
- `ReportScheduleConfig` (P15-5) — scheduling config persisted in settings
- `ExportConfig` — date range, limit, threshold knobs
- Redis job queue configured in Docker Compose (P13-2)

The question: which cloud warehouse, at what cost, and should we build this now?

---

## Options Evaluated

### Option A: Google BigQuery

**Strengths:**
- Serverless, zero-ops, excellent JSON ingestion (`bq load --source_format=NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON`)
- Pay-per-query ($5/TB scanned), storage at $0.02/GB/month
- Free tier: 10 GB storage + 1 TB queries/month
- Strong BI tool integrations (Looker, Data Studio, Tableau)

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires GCP project + service account setup per tenant
- Cold-start query latency ~1-2s (acceptable for analytics)
- Data residency concerns for non-US merchants

**Integration effort:** ~2 days — REST API streaming insert or batch load via `google-cloud-rust`

---

### Option B: Snowflake

**Strengths:**
- Best-in-class SQL analytics, zero-copy cloning for report snapshots
- JSON via VARIANT type with automatic schema inference
- Time Travel (1-90 day data recovery)
- Strong data sharing for multi-store franchises

**Weaknesses:**
- Minimum $25/month compute credits (no true free tier)
- Cold warehouse spin-up 1-3 minutes
- Overkill for single-store merchants

**Integration effort:** ~3 days — `snowflake-api` crate + ODBC/JDBC driver setup

---

### Option C: ClickHouse (Self-Hosted)

**Strengths:**
- Columnar, real-time analytics, 10-100x faster than row stores
- Open-source (no per-query costs)
- Native JSON support with `JSONExtract` functions
- Runs on a $10/month VPS for most POS workloads

**Weaknesses:**
- Self-hosted — requires ops for backups, upgrades, monitoring
- Less ecosystem maturity than BigQuery/Snowflake
- No managed offering in all regions

**Integration effort:** ~2 days — `clickhouse-rs` crate, HTTP interface, Docker Compose service

---

### Option D: Parquet File Export (Simplest)

**Strengths:**
- Zero infrastructure — write Parquet to disk, sync via existing cloud-sync
- Columnar, compressed, queryable by DuckDB, pandas, Spark
- No vendor lock-in, no per-query costs
- Works offline — export runs on the POS terminal itself

**Weaknesses:**
- No live dashboards (batch-only)
- Requires merchant to have their own analytics tool
- File management overhead

**Integration effort:** ~1 day — `parquet` + `arrow` crates, write to `exports/` directory

---

## Recommendation

**Short-term (0.0.15-0.0.16): Implement Option D — Parquet export.**

Add `analytics_bundle_to_parquet()` to the export module. Write `.parquet` files to a configurable directory. The existing cloud-sync infrastructure can sync these to cloud storage. This gives merchants immediate access to their analytics data with zero additional infrastructure cost.

**Medium-term (post-1.0): Add BigQuery streaming insert as an on-feature.**

The `AnalyticsBundle` JSON format already maps cleanly to BigQuery's `NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON` ingestion. Gate behind `ANALYTICS_EXPORT` feature flag. Charge as premium add-on.

**Deferred:** Snowflake (cost-prohibitive for small merchants), ClickHouse self-hosted (ops burden).

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Monthly Cost (est.) | Setup Time | Query Latency |
|--------|---------------------|------------|---------------|
| BigQuery | $0-5 (free tier for most) | 2 days | 1-2s |
| Snowflake | $25+ (minimum compute) | 3 days | 1-3 min (cold start) |
| ClickHouse | $10-20 (VPS) | 2 days | <100ms |
| Parquet | $0 (local disk) | 1 day | N/A (batch) |
