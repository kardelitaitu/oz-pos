# Release Checklist — OZ-POS

<!-- Audit stamp: 2026-09-04 · DSH · status: STALE-BY-INFRA-CHANGE (re-audited) · supersedes the 2026-08-31 docs-auditor stamp, whose central claim was false: it asserted "all CI job names exist in workflows (rust-fmt/rust-clippy/rust-test-fast/ui-lint/ui-typecheck/ui-test/release-validate)" — six of those seven are ci.yml/release.yml job names, and 23c96330 retired both to .bak on 2026-09-02. Only ui-test survives, and it survives as a different job with different steps. Re-verified this pass: the five scripts the old stamp listed ARE all present (lint-i18n.sh, check-release-version.mjs, bump-version.ps1, generate-latest-json.mjs, verify-updater-signature.mjs); [profile.ci] IS at .config/nextest.toml:26; the latest.json/beta.json updater endpoints ARE in apps/desktop-client/tauri.conf.json:69-70. But UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY now exists only in release.yml.bak, and every workflow with a tags: trigger is .bak (release, android, ios, ci, nightly, e2e-pr) while the sole live dev-ci.yml has no build or artifact step — so tagging v* triggers nothing. The Pre-Release job list and the release-validate step have been rewritten to what runs; a 🛑 block now states which steps must be done by hand. Size targets (<100MB/<50MB/<5MB) and smoke-test steps remain operational, not code-falsifiable -->

> Follow these steps in order for every release. Mark each item as completed.

> ## 🛑 The release pipeline is not currently running
>
> **Every workflow with a `tags:` trigger is `.bak`** — `release.yml`,
> `android.yml`, `ios.yml`, `ci.yml`, `nightly.yml`, `e2e-pr.yml` — retired by
> `23c96330` on 2026-09-02. GitHub never executes a `.bak` file. The only live
> workflow is `dev-ci.yml`, and it contains **no build or artifact steps**.
>
> Concretely, as of this writing:
>
> | Checklist step | What actually happens |
> |---|---|
> | `git tag -a vX.Y.Z` + push | **triggers nothing** |
> | `release-validate` job | does not exist in any live workflow |
> | Desktop installers built + attached | **nothing builds them** |
> | Mobile APK/AAB + IPA via tag workflows | those workflows are `.bak` |
> | `latest.json` / `beta.json` in the release | nothing generates or uploads them |
>
> **Everything from "## Build Verification" onward must be done by hand** until
> the release workflow is restored — tracked as **R36-11** in
> [`docs/plans/0.0.36-backlog.md`](../plans/0.0.36-backlog.md). Do not mark those
> boxes on the assumption CI produced the artifacts; check the release's asset
> list. See [`first-release-runbook.md`](./first-release-runbook.md) for the
> manual route, which is stamped `STALE-BY-INFRA-CHANGE` for the same reason.

## Pre-Release

- [ ] All CI jobs pass — `dev-ci.yml` jobs are `website`, `cargo-check`
      (fmt → check → clippy), `cargo-nextest`, `ui-test` (typecheck → lint →
      vitest → tz-invariance), `i18n`, `northflank-deploy`. This is the **entire**
      live CI surface; see the warning block above before assuming anything else
      is gated.
- [ ] `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features --profile ci` passes locally
- [ ] `cd ui && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test` passes locally
- [ ] `bash scripts/lint-i18n.sh` clean (no duplicate FTL keys, no verbatim ID bundles)
- [ ] Changelog generated at `docs/releases/CHANGELOG-{version}.md` with all changes since last release
- [ ] `## [{version}]` heading present in canonical `CHANGELOG.md` (the release version gate `node scripts/check-release-version.mjs v{version}` passes locally)
- [ ] Version bumped in: `Cargo.toml` (workspace), `ui/package.json`, `tauri.conf.json` files (via `scripts/bump-version.ps1 {version}`)
- [ ] Breaking changes documented with migration guide if needed

## Build Verification

- [ ] Docker image builds: `docker build -f Dockerfile.server -t oz-pos-cloud:latest .`
- [ ] Docker image size < 100 MB
- [ ] Desktop **installers** build (raw `cargo build --release` is not a release artifact):
  - Linux: `cargo tauri build --bundles appimage,deb`
  - Windows: `cargo tauri build --bundles nsis,msi` (code-signed when `UPDATER_CERT` is set)
  - macOS: `cargo tauri build --bundles dmg`
- [ ] Desktop binary size < 50 MB
- [ ] UI bundle builds: `cd ui && npm run build`
- [ ] UI bundle size < 5 MB

## Updater Manifest (RELEASE-04)

- [ ] Release contains `latest.json` + `beta.json` (matching `tauri.conf.json` updater endpoints)
- [ ] `node scripts/generate-latest-json.mjs --self-test` and `node scripts/verify-updater-signature.mjs --self-test` pass
- [ ] `node scripts/verify-updater-signature.mjs latest.json <platform> <installer>` verifies for every shipped platform
- [ ] `UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY` secret derives to the pubkey embedded in `tauri.conf.json` (the workflow fails otherwise)
- [ ] Release contains `SHA256SUMS.txt` and provenance attestations for the exact installers

## Smoke Test

- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Login flow works (PIN entry → workspace picker → POS screen)
- [ ] Basic sale works (add product → pay → receipt)
- [ ] Settings page loads and saves
- [ ] Offline mode works (disable network, complete sale)

## Release

- [ ] Git tag created: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`
- [ ] Version gate verified **manually**: `node scripts/check-release-version.mjs vX.Y.Z`
      passes locally. The `release-validate` job that used to enforce this in CI
      lived in `release.yml`, which is `.bak` — pushing the tag does not run it.
- [ ] GitHub Release created (draft → published only after asset inventory passes)
- [ ] Docker image pushed to GHCR
- [ ] Desktop installers built + attached (AppImage/deb, NSIS/MSI, DMG)
- [ ] Mobile APK/AAB + IPA attached to the same release (via their tag workflows)
- [ ] Rollback verified: previous version installer reinstalls cleanly on a test terminal (see `release-process.md`)
- [ ] Release announced to team/channel
