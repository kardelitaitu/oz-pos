# Mobile Release Checklist

> **Purpose:** Pre-release verification for Android APK and iOS IPA builds.
> Run through this checklist before every mobile release.
>
> **Estimated time:** 45–60 minutes

## Android

### Build Verification

- [ ] **APK builds without errors**
  - Trigger: GitHub Actions **Android Build** workflow
  - Download the APK artifact
- [ ] **APK is signed**
  - `apksigner verify --print-certs oz-pos-tablet-aarch64.apk`
  - CN matches the release keystore DN
- [ ] **APK size is reasonable**
  - Compare against previous release (±5 MB is normal)
  - If >100 MB, investigate debug symbols or unused assets

### Installation

- [ ] **APK installs cleanly**

  - Storage (backup export)
  - Bluetooth (receipt printer, NFC reader)

### Functional Testing

- [ ] **Staff login works** (PIN entry)
- [ ] **Barcode scanner** scans a test barcode
- [ ] **POS flow:** Add item → complete sale → receipt
- [ ] **Settings:** All tabs open without error
- [ ] **Offline mode:** Enable airplane mode → complete sale → reconnect → sync

- [ ] **App installs from TestFlight** without errors

### Functional Testing

- [ ] **Staff login works** (PIN entry)
- [ ] **Touch targets ≥ 44px** (all interactive elements)
- [ ] **Split-view multitasking:** App renders correctly in 1/2 and 1/3 width
- [ ] **Swipe gestures:** Swipe-left/right on cart panel works (P7-1)
- [ ] **Keyboard:** Hardware keyboard shortcuts work (F1–F12)
- [ ] **Orientation:** App works in both portrait and landscape
