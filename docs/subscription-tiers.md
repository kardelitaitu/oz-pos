# Subscription Tiers — Final Decisions

> **Status: FINAL** — Approved 2026-08-17. Single source of truth for tier
> pricing, quotas, and feature gates. Supersedes the tier/pricing sections of
> `docs/BUSINESS_PLAN.md` §2, ADR #5, and the older pricing content until
> those are updated to match.

## 1. Lineup

**Five tiers: Free · Plus · Pro · Premium · Enterprise**

| Tier | Position |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Free** | Free forever — 1 workspace only (1 store, 1 terminal, 1 warehouse, 30-day sales history) |
| **Plus** | Entry paid tier — hero feature: **Daily Sales Dashboard** (Laporan Harian) |
| **Pro** ⭐ **Most Popular** | Mid paid tier — best for growing single-to-multi-store businesses |
| **Premium** | Top paid tier — multi-store chains with loyalty & automation |
| **Enterprise** | Bespoke — no list price, contact sales |

## 2. Pricing

USD and IDR are **independent market prices**: global customers pay the USD
rate; Indonesian customers pay the IDR rate (lower, set for the local
market). See **Payment routing** below for how each is charged.

| Tier | USD/mo | USD/yr (**2 months free**) | IDR/mo | IDR/yr (**2 bulan gratis**) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Free** | $0 | — | Rp 0 | — |
| **Plus** | $4.99 | $49.99 | Rp 49.000 | Rp 500.000 |
| **Pro** ⭐ | $9.99 | $99.99 | Rp 99.000 | Rp 1.000.000 |
| **Premium** | $19.99 | $199.99 | Rp 199.000 | Rp 2.000.000 |
| **Enterprise** | Bespoke | Bespoke | Kustom | Kustom |

Yearly = **2 months free** (pay 10 months, get 12). Always market as "2 months free" /
"2 bulan gratis" — not as a percentage discount. Annual plan must be the **default
selection** on the pricing page; users actively switch to monthly.
Six Paddle prices total (Plus/Pro/Premium × monthly/yearly).

### Enterprise Pricing Guidance

Enterprise pricing should be defined within these ranges to ensure consistency:
- **Small Enterprise (5-20 stores):** $100-200/mo or Rp 1.000.000-2.000.000/mo
- **Medium Enterprise (21-100 stores):** $200-400/mo or Rp 2.000.000-4.000.000/mo
- **Large Enterprise (100+ stores):** $400+/mo or Rp 4.000.000+/mo

Final pricing determined by: number of stores, terminals, users, support level, and custom integrations required.

### Payment routing

| Market | Provider | Currency | Payment methods |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Global** | Paddle (MoR) | USD | cards |
| **Indonesia** | **Midtrans** (Phase 2) | IDR, fixed Rp | QRIS, virtual accounts, e-wallets, cards |

- **Phase 1 (now):** Paddle for everyone. The IDR rates are honored via
  Paddle country price overrides for Indonesia — Paddle geolocates the
  buyer's IP at checkout and applies the override for the country selected.
  IDR isn't a supported currency, so the override is a USD amount ≈ the Rp
  figure (e.g. Premium yearly ≈ $125), which drifts with FX.
- **Phase 2 (next) — CRITICAL revenue unlock:** route Indonesian customers to a
  **Midtrans** checkout — fixed Rp prices and local payment methods (QRIS, virtual
  accounts, e-wallets) that cards alone can't reach; Paddle stays for global.
  Midtrans over Xendit because `oz-payment` already integrates Midtrans QRIS
  for in-store payments. **Without Phase 2, the Indonesian TAM is effectively limited
  to card-holding customers — a fraction of the 65M MSME market. This is not optional
  for Indonesian revenue growth.**
- **Costs of Phase 2:** OZ-POS becomes merchant of record for ID payments
  (Indonesian PPN, refunds, disputes); a second webhook + provisioning path
  in the license server; local-method subscriptions are less mature than
  card auto-renew.

## 3. Quota & feature matrix

### Quick Reference: Best For

> **Positioning statement:** OZ-POS is the QRIS-native POS with offline-first reliability,
> priced for the Indonesian market. Lead every ad, landing page, and sales conversation
> with this — not tier names.

| Tier | Best For | Hero Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Free** | Warung / kios trying OZ-POS — limited to 30 days of sales history | Cash POS + receipt printing |
| **Plus** | Single-store shops ready to grow from manual to smart | **Daily Sales Dashboard** (Laporan Harian) + QRIS |
| **Pro** ⭐ | Cafes, toko, growing businesses ready for full analytics & KDS | Analytics + KDS + multi-terminal |
| **Premium** | Multi-store chains needing loyalty & automation | Loyalty program + unlimited stores + 1h support |
| **Enterprise** | Large organizations needing white-label, custom hardware & dedicated support | Account manager + custom HAL drivers |

### Numeric Limits

| Feature | Free | Plus | Pro | Premium | Enterprise |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Max stores | 1 | 1 | 2 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Max terminals (registers) / store | 1 | 2 | 5 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Max warehouses | 1 | 2 | 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Max KDS screens | 0 | 0 | 1 / store | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Max staff users * | 1 | 5 | 20 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Sales history (view & export) ** | 30 days | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |

\* Max staff users — **MUST be enforced before launch** to prevent revenue leakage.

\*\* Sales history cap — **MUST be enforced before launch**. Free users see only the last
30 days of transactions. After 30+ days of use, the owner naturally wants to compare
months — that is the primary upgrade trigger for Free → Plus. Show a blurred/locked
history preview with an upgrade CTA, not a hard error.

## 4. Trial & Conversion Strategy

### Free Tier Trial Flow
- Free tier provides permanent access to basic features (1 store, 1 terminal, 1 staff, **30-day sales history**)
- Trial offer is **segmented by signup vertical** — do NOT offer Pro trial universally:
  a Pro trial anchors users to features they won't pay for and suppresses Plus conversion.

| Signup segment | Trial offer | Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| General signup (no vertical detected) | **14-day Plus trial** | Exposes QRIS + Daily Sales Dashboard — the two hooks that drive Plus conversion |
| Restaurant / cafe landing page | **14-day Pro trial** | KDS is the key differentiator; Pro is the natural landing tier for this vertical |
| Referred by an Enterprise customer | **30-day Pro trial** | High-intent lead; longer trial cost is justified |

- After trial ends: show a clear downgrade screen listing exactly what the user loses,
  with a one-click upgrade path — not a generic error page.

### Trial-to-Paid Conversion — General / Plus Trial (14-day)
- **Day 3:** In-app highlight of Daily Sales Dashboard — show yesterday's summary prominently
- **Day 7:** Email — *"Here's what your first week looked like"* (personalized sales totals)
- **Day 10:** In-app QRIS stats — how many digital payments were processed during the trial
- **Day 14 (last day):** Final email — 30-day history limit warning + upgrade CTA
- **Day 14 (end of trial):** Downgrade screen with blurred history preview and
  *"Upgrade ke Plus untuk tetap melihat riwayat penjualan Anda"*

### Trial-to-Paid Conversion — Pro Trial / Restaurant & Cafe Vertical (14-day)
- **Day 3:** In-app KDS setup guide + first order simulation
- **Day 7:** Email — *"X orders went through your kitchen display this week"*
- **Day 14:** In-app analytics showing peak hours chart + Pro upgrade CTA
- **Day 14 (end of trial):** Downgrade screen — *"KDS akan dinonaktifkan. Upgrade ke Pro untuk melanjutkan."*

### Upgrade/Downgrade Policy
- **Upgrades:** Effective immediately; prorated billing for remainder of current cycle
- **Downgrades:** Effective at end of current billing cycle; no partial refunds
- **Downgrade grace period:** 14 days to export data before feature restrictions apply

### Trial Anti-Abuse Lock (Implemented)

A **hardware-fingerprint trial lock** prevents trial reset abuse by limiting one trial per physical device:

- **Implementation:** Server-side `trial_registrations` collection keyed by hardware fingerprint; claim endpoint (`POST /api/v1/license/trial`) and activation-time gate (`enforceTrialLock`).
- **Trust boundary:** Only **trial keys** are gated; paid keys are never locked.
- **Client:** `get_hardware_fingerprint()` computes `hw_` + SHA-256 of the same hardware anchor `machine_id` uses (Windows MachineGuid / motherboard UUID / `/etc/machine-id`).
- **Remaining gap:** Devices with no queryable hardware anchor (minimal containers) fall back to a random UUID stable only within a process; claims are permanent by design, so an expired trial never frees the device.

> For the full specification, see `docs/specs/hardware-fingerprint-trial-lock.md`.
> For deviations from the original spec and shipped implementation details, see **ADR #23 Deviation 3** in `docs/decisions/2026-07-20-free-trial-lifecycle-and-license-activation-workflow.md`.

## 5. Vertical Go-to-Market Strategy

> Customers do not self-identify as "Pro tier users." They identify as cafe owners,
> minimarket operators, or salon managers. All GTM — landing pages, ads, onboarding
> flows — must lead with vertical language, not tier names.

### Vertical × Tier Map

| Vertical | Entry Hook | Natural Tier | Key Features to Highlight |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Warung / Kios** | Free → QRIS + daily summary | Plus | Daily Sales Dashboard, QRIS, cloud backup |
| **Kafe / Coffee shop** | KDS demo | Pro | KDS, analytics, multi-terminal |
| **Toko / Minimarket** | Inventory + multi-terminal | Pro | Multi-terminal, warehouse, stock visibility |
| **Salon / Laundry** | Staff & receipt management | Plus/Pro | Staff management, product bundles |
| **Restoran / Rumah Makan** | KDS + loyalty | Pro → Premium | KDS, loyalty points, scheduled reports |
| **Retail chain** | Multi-store ops | Premium | Unlimited stores, analytics, priority support |

### Vertical Landing Pages (Month 1-3 priority)
Create dedicated landing pages per vertical — higher-converting than a generic pricing page:
- `/untuk-kafe` — leads with KDS demo video → Pro trial CTA
- `/untuk-minimarket` — leads with inventory + multi-terminal → Pro trial CTA
- `/untuk-warung` — leads with QRIS + daily summary → Plus CTA
- `/untuk-restoran` — leads with loyalty + automation → Premium CTA

### Vertical-Specific Bundles (Month 3-6)
| Bundle | Target | Included Features | Discount |
|--------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Restaurant Starter** | Cafes, warung | POS + KDS + basic inventory | 10% off vs à la carte |
| **Retail Pro** | Toko, minimarket | POS + advanced inventory + loyalty | 10% off vs à la carte |
| **Service Business** | Salons, repair shops | POS + staff management + receipts | 10% off vs à la carte |

- Available as add-ons within existing tiers
- Custom bundles for Enterprise customers

## 6. In-App Upgrade Triggers

> Upgrade prompts must fire at the moment of felt need — not as generic banners.
> Each trigger has a specific condition and a specific message.

### Free → Plus Triggers
| Condition | Trigger message |
| :--- | :--- |
| User views sales history older than 30 days | Blurred preview: *"Lihat riwayat lebih dari 30 hari — upgrade ke Plus"* |
| User attempts to set up QRIS | *"Aktifkan QRIS — terima pembayaran digital. Upgrade ke Plus"* |
| Second staff member tries to log in | *"Tambah anggota tim — upgrade ke Plus, hingga 5 staff"* |

### Plus → Pro Triggers
| Condition | Trigger message |
| :--- | :--- |
| User opens analytics/reports tab (locked) | Locked screen with sample chart: *"Lihat laporan lengkap — upgrade ke Pro"* |
| User attempts to add a second store | *"Buka toko ke-2 — upgrade ke Pro"* |
| Terminal count reaches 2 (Plus limit) | *"Butuh lebih banyak kasir? Pro mendukung hingga 5 terminal per toko"* |

### Pro → Premium Triggers
| Condition | Trigger message |
| :--- | :--- |
| Store count reaches 2 (approaching Pro limit) | *"Buka toko ke-3? Upgrade ke Premium — unlimited stores"* |
| Staff count reaches 16+ (approaching 20 limit) | *"Tim Anda berkembang! Premium mendukung unlimited staff"* |
| User views loyalty module (locked teaser) | Animated loyalty dashboard preview: *"Hadirkan program poin — upgrade ke Premium"* |

## 7. Churn Prevention

### Churn Risk by Tier

| Tier | Churn risk | Primary reason | Key intervention |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Plus** | 🔴 High | "Doesn't do enough" or post-Pro-trial letdown | Strong Daily Sales Dashboard onboarding, 30-day history trigger |
| **Pro** | 🟡 Medium | Staff/store limit reached without prompt | Proactive usage alerts at 80% of limits |
| **Premium** | 🟢 Low | Occasional downgrade to Pro | Enterprise self-serve pathway |
| **Enterprise** | 🟢 Very Low | Long contracts | Quarterly business reviews |

### Features to Implement
- ✅ **Pause subscription:** Allow 1-3 month pause (retain data, no billing) — C3.3
- ✅ **Win-back campaigns:** Automated emails at 7d + 30d post-expiry with 20%/30% discount offers
- ✅ **Usage monitoring:** Alert at 80% of limits (staff at 16/20, stores at cap, terminals at cap)
- ✅ **Feedback collection:** Exit survey modal with 6 churn-reason options

### Metrics to Track
- Monthly churn rate by tier
- Upgrade/downgrade ratios
- Trial-to-paid conversion rate (target: 25%+)
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) by tier

## 8. Where each definition lives (source map)

| File | Role | Tier source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/BUSINESS_PLAN.md` §2 | Market/pricing plan (IDR, annual) | 1-Time / Standard / Pro / Enterprise — **superseded banner added 2026-08-17**; content kept as historical analysis |
| `docs/decisions/2026-07-10-subscription-tier-entitlement.md` (ADR #5) | Design intent | Free / Pro / Premium / Enterprise with numeric quotas — **supersession note added 2026-08-17** (mechanism still valid; quotas from §3) |
| `docs/decisions/2026-07-20-free-trial-lifecycle-and-license-activation-workflow.md` (ADR #23) | Trial lifecycle + custom_data contracts | 90-day trial — **re-scope note + 3 deviation notes** (see [cross-ref](../decisions/README.md)): **Dev 1:** segmented trials implemented 2026-08-18 (`trial_vertical` in `activate.go`, 14-day Plus general / 14-day Pro restaurant-cafe / 30-day Pro enterprise-referral). **Dev 2:** Paddle `custom_data` contract documented — `email` (register-first, webhook upserts tenant) + `bundle` (C3.2, cross-checked against price map) + `phone` (backfilled); signup vertical **not** carried. **Dev 3:** hardware-fingerprint trial lock shipped (`trial_registrations`, `POST /license/trial`, `enforceTrialLock`, client `get_hardware_fingerprint`). |

| `website/src/components/paddle.ts` → `openPaddleCheckout()` | Checkout custom_data embedder | Embeds `custom_data.email` (required) + `custom_data.bundle` (optional C3.2) + `custom_data.phone` (may ride along); vertical **not** carried (see ADR #23 Dev 2) |

| `apps/license-server` `MIDTRANS_PRICE_TIERS` (env) | Midtrans billing map | Fixed IDR amounts mapped to tier + period + optional bundle; cross-checked against webhook `gross_amount` and `custom_field1`–`custom_field4` (ADR #39 Dev 2–4) |

## 9. Implementation Priorities

### Pre-Launch (Critical — before any paid marketing spend)
1. ✅ **Enforce staff user limits** — `enforce_staff_quota()` in staff.rs, wired in desktop + tablet clients
2. ✅ **Enforce 30-day sales history cap on Free** — `list_sales_with_history_cap()` in sales.rs
3. ✅ **Set annual plan as default on pricing page** — PricingGrid.tsx defaults to annual
4. ✅ **Add ⭐ Most Popular badge to Pro** on pricing page — `mostPopular` in i18n
5. ✅ **Reframe annual discount as "2 bulan gratis" / "2 months free"** — all docs and pricing pages
6. ✅ **Build Daily Sales Dashboard as the hero feature of Plus** — `DailyTotalWidget.tsx` with Free-tier lock (blurred teaser + upgrade CTA)
7. ✅ **Define Enterprise pricing guidance** — ranges defined in §2
8. ✅ **Enforce store-count quota on creation** — `enforce_store_quota()` blocks Free/Plus at 1, Pro at 2
9. ✅ **Enforce warehouse-count quota on creation** — `enforce_warehouse_quota()` blocks Free at 1, Plus at 2, Pro at 3

### Short-Term (Month 1-3)
10. ✅ **Implement segmented trial strategy** — 14-day Plus trial for general; 14-day Pro for restaurant/cafe; 30-day Pro for enterprise-referral
11. ✅ **Build vertical landing pages** — `/untuk-kafe`, `/untuk-warung`, `/untuk-minimarket`, `/untuk-restoran` — `VerticalLanding.astro` component with i18n, segmented trial CTAs, bundle paths
12. ✅ **Implement in-app upgrade triggers** — All 9 triggers wired: TierLockedFeature (analytics, loyalty, daily dashboard, QRIS), quota error banners (staff, store, terminal), proactive alerts at 80% (staff approaching 16/20, store at 2/2)
13. ✅ **Implement upgrade/downgrade proration** — `paddleUpdate()` in paddle_webhook.go handles tier transitions; Paddle handles proration billing; grace period via `offline_grace_days`

### Medium-Term (Month 3-6)
14. ✅ **Phase 2: Midtrans QRIS subscriptions** — `midtrans_webhook.go` + Snap checkout implemented; ID payment routing with custom fields (ADR #39)
15. ✅ **Build trial-to-paid email flows** — `trial_emails.go` scheduler with Brevo SMTP; day 7 + day 14 milestones for Plus and Pro trials; bilingual EN/ID templates; idempotent via `trial_email_log` collection
16. ✅ **Create vertical-specific bundles** — `restaurant_starter` bundle implemented (C3.2); unlocks KDS workspace type for Plus
17. ✅ **Implement pause subscription feature** — pause/resume endpoints + `paused_at`/`pause_until` fields (C3.3)

### Long-Term (Month 6-12)
18. ✅ **A/B test Pro at $7.99 vs $9.99** — Paddle-native A/B testing via `PADDLE_PRICE_TIERS` config; create two Pro prices and let Paddle split traffic
19. ✅ **Enterprise self-serve trial / Premium store-limit bridge** — `POST /api/v1/license/enterprise-trial` validates approval codes from PocketBase collection, mints 30-day Enterprise trial license key; admin endpoints (`/api/v1/admin/enterprise-codes`) for code generation/listing; `/enterprise-trial` Astro page with EN/ID i18n; `enterprise_self_serve` vertical in `trialSegmentation`
20. ✅ **Launch add-on marketplace** — addon catalog (4 addons: advanced_analytics, priority_support, extra_storage, custom_hal) with Paddle price IDs; `TenantSubscription::addons()` + `has_addon()` in Rust; `AddonsMarketplace` component with card grid; admin API (`/api/v1/admin/license-addons`) for managing addon purchases on license keys; addons field wired through `SubscriptionCapabilitiesDto` to front-end
21. ✅ **Build churn prevention automation** — win-back emails (7d + 30d post-expiry), exit survey modal, usage monitoring alerts at 80% limits

## Appendix: Financial Formulas

### Unit Economics Calculations

#### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
```
LTV = ARPU × (1 / Churn Rate)
Example (Plus): $4.50 × (1 / 0.08) = $56.25
```

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers Acquired
Target: LTV / CAC ≥ 3:1
```

#### Payback Period
```
Payback Period = CAC / ARPU
Example (Plus): $25 / $4.50 = 5.6 months
```

#### Break-Even Point
```
Break-Even Customers = Fixed Costs / (ARPU × (1 - Variable Cost %))
Example: $30,000 / ($15 × 0.94) = 2,128 customers
```

#### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
```
MRR = Σ (Monthly Revenue from All Customers)
ARR = MRR × 12
```

#### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
```
NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting MRR
Target: >100% (growth from existing customers)
```

| 4% | $112 | $225 | $450 |
| 2% | $225 | $450 | $900 |

#### Impact of ARPU Changes on Break-Even
| ARPU | Customers Needed | Time to Break-Even |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $10 | 3,192 | 24 months |
| $12 | 2,660 | 20 months |
