---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Check |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Mac computer | Apple Silicon (M1+) or Intel | `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType` |
| Xcode | 16+ | `xcodebuild -version` |
| iOS SDK | 18+ | Included with Xcode |
| iPad device | iPadOS 16.0+ | Settings → General → About → iPadOS Version |
| Apple Developer account | Paid ($99/yr) or free | [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) |
| Rust toolchain | stable (1.85+) | `rustc --version` |
| Node.js | 20+ LTS | `node --version` |
| Tauri CLI | ^2 | `cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2" --locked` |
| Rust targets (iOS) | 3 targets | `rustup target list --installed \| grep ios` |
| TestFlight app | Installed on iPad | App Store → TestFlight |

### Installing Prerequisites

**Xcode:**

```bash
# Install from the Mac App Store, or:
xcode-select --install  # Command Line Tools
# Full Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
```

**Rust + iOS targets:**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
rustup default stable
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim
```

**Node.js:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
# Or on macOS: brew install node@22
```

**Tauri CLI:**

```bash
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2" --locked
```

### Apple Developer Account Setup

1. Enroll in the **Apple Developer Program** ($99/year) at
   [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)
2. **If you don't have a paid account**, you can still test on a physical
   device with a free account, but you'll need to reinstall every 7 days.
   TestFlight requires a paid account.

### Add Device to Apple Developer Portal

For TestFlight or direct deployment, your iPad's UDID must be registered:

```bash
# Get the UDID by connecting the iPad via USB
xcrun xctrace list devices 2>&1 | grep -i ipad
# Example output: OZ-POS iPad (00008030-XXXXXXXXXXXX) ...

# Or find UDID in Xcode: Window → Devices and Simulators → select iPad
```

Then add it at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/devices/add).

---

## Build Steps

### One-Time: Initialize the iOS Project

```bash
cd apps/tablet-client
cargo tauri ios init
cd ../..
```

This generates `gen/apple/` (do **not** commit — it is .gitignored).

> **Important:** If you see "already initialized", delete it first:
> `rm -rf apps/tablet-client/gen/apple/` then re-run.

### Option A — Quick Simulator Test (No Physical Device)

```bash
# Build frontend first
cd ui && npx vite build --config vite.tablet.config.ts && cd ..

# Launch in iOS simulator
cd apps/tablet-client
cargo tauri ios dev
cd ../..
```

This opens the iOS simulator and runs the app with hot-reload.
Useful for initial layout verification before deploying to a physical device.

### Option B — Debug IPA for Physical Device

```bash
# Build frontend
cd ui && npx vite build --config vite.tablet.config.ts && cd ..

# Build debug IPA
cd apps/tablet-client
cargo tauri ios build
cd ../..
```

Output location:
```
apps/tablet-client/gen/apple/build/oz-pos-tablet.ipa
```

### Option C — Release IPA (Signed, for TestFlight)

```bash
# Build frontend
cd ui && npx vite build --config vite.tablet.config.ts && cd ..

# Open the Xcode project to configure signing first
cd apps/tablet-client
cargo tauri ios init  # if not done already
open gen/apple/oz-pos-tablet.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:
1. Select the **oz-pos-tablet** target
2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities**
3. Select your **Team** from the dropdown
4. Ensure **Bundle Identifier** is unique (e.g., `com.yourcompany.ozpos.tablet`)
5. Switch **Build Configuration** to **Release** in the scheme editor

Then build from terminal:

```bash
cargo tauri ios build --release
```

Output location:
```
apps/tablet-client/gen/apple/build/oz-pos-tablet.ipa
```

> ℹ️ The exact IPA output path may vary by Tauri CLI version and project name.
> If the file is not at the expected path, run:
> ```bash
> find apps/tablet-client/gen/apple -name "*.ipa" 2>/dev/null
> ```

### Option D — Via CI (GitHub Actions)

The `.github/workflows/ios.yml` workflow builds a signed IPA on tag
or manual trigger. To use it:

1. Set up the required **secrets** in your GitHub repository:

   | Secret | Purpose |
   |--------|---------|
   | `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Your Apple Developer Team ID |
   | `APPLE_BUNDLE_ID` | Bundle identifier (e.g., `com.ozpos.tablet`) |
   | `APPLE_PROV_PROFILE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded provisioning profile |
   | `APPLE_CERT_BASE64` | Base64-encoded distribution certificate p12 |
   | `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD` | Certificate password |
   | `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | Temporary keychain password (any value) |

2. Create and push a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.0.16
   git push origin v0.0.16
   ```

3. Download the IPA artifact from the Actions run.

## Install on iPad

### Via TestFlight (Recommended)

TestFlight is the standard Apple-sanctioned beta distribution method.
It allows you to distribute builds to up to 10,000 testers without
manual UDID registration.

**App Store Connect setup:**

1. Go to [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. **Apps** → **+** → **New App**
3. Fill in:
   - **Platform:** iOS
   - **Name:** OZ-POS Tablet
   - **Bundle ID:** `com.ozpos.tablet` (must match Xcode)
   - **SKU:** `OZPOS_TABLET_001`
4. Submit (app does not need to be "complete" for TestFlight)

**Upload build to TestFlight:**

```bash
# Install Xcode command line tools (includes altool/transporter)
# Option A: Xcode Organizer (GUI)
open ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/
# Find the .xcarchive → Distribute App → TestFlight

# Option B: Using Transporter (App Store Connect)
# Open the Transporter app → Add IPA → Deliver

# Option C: Using notarytool or altool (CLI)
xcrun altool --upload-app \
  -f apps/tablet-client/gen/apple/build/oz-pos-tablet.ipa \
  -t ios \
  -u "your-apple-id@example.com" \
  -p "@keychain:AC_PASSWORD"
```

**Add internal testers:**

1. App Store Connect → **TestFlight** → **Internal Testing**
2. Add yourself and your team members as testers
3. Build status: **Processing** (5–30 min) → **Ready to Submit**
4. Click **Submit for Review** (automated, < 1 hour)
5. Testers receive an email invitation with a TestFlight link

**Install on iPad:**

1. Install **TestFlight** from the App Store
2. Tap the invitation link (or open TestFlight → **Redeem** → enter code)
3. Tap **Install** → wait for download
4. Tap **Open** to launch OZ-POS

### Via Direct Sideloading (Free Account, 7-Day Limit)

For developers without a paid account, you can sideload with a 7-day expiry:

```bash
# Build a debug IPA
cargo tauri ios build

# Install directly via Xcode
open apps/tablet-client/gen/apple/oz-pos-tablet.xcodeproj
# Xcode → select your iPad from the device dropdown → Run (▶)

# Or install via iOS Console.app and ideviceinstaller
brew install ideviceinstaller
ideviceinstaller -i apps/tablet-client/gen/apple/build/oz-pos-tablet.ipa
```

### Update Existing Build

TestFlight handles updates seamlessly:

1. Upload a new build to App Store Connect
2. The new build appears in TestFlight automatically
3. Testers get a notification: "An update is available"
4. Tap **Update** — no data loss
