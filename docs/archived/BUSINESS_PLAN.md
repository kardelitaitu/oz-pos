# Business Plan: OZ-POS Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

**OZ-POS** is a modular, high-performance, and offline-first Point-of-Sale (POS) software framework built using Rust and Tauri v2.
Unlike legacy cloud-reliant POS systems, OZ-POS utilizes a local-first architecture (SQLite edge databases coupled with an asynchronous cloud sync daemon) to provide sub-millisecond barcode scan latency and 100% uptime, even during internet outages.

### Mission Statement
To democratize enterprise-grade, zero-downtime point-of-sale infrastructure for Indonesian retail merchants, food & beverage outlets, and franchises, bridging the gap between local reliability and cloud intelligence.

## 3. Market Analysis: The Indonesian Opportunity

Indonesia hosts over **64 million Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs / UMKM)**, contributing more than 61% of the national GDP.

### 3.1 Pain Points Addressed
1.  **Internet Instability:** Many cloud-only POS systems crash or lock up when cellular or fiber connections drop. OZ-POS's offline-first architecture allows sales to process continuously.
2.  **Exorbitant Platform Fees:** Competitors often charge transactional commissions or high monthly fees. OZ-POS offers predictable flat-rate subscription pricing (plus a free-forever tier).
3.  **Hardware Lock-in & Forced Upgrades:** Many POS competitors lock merchants into buying proprietary tablets or expensive modern registers. Furthermore, legacy systems built on heavy frameworks (like Electron/Java) run sluggishly on budget hardware, forcing hardware upgrade CAPEX. The native Rust + Tauri v2 core of OZ-POS is extremely lightweight, extending the lifecycle of legacy and budget terminals.

### 3.2 Competitive Landscape Matrix

| Competitor | Pricing Model | Offline Capability | Customizability | Hardware Lock-in | Payment MDR Fees | Taxation & Promo Engine | Target Audience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Moka POS** | SaaS (IDR 3.5jt - 6jt / yr) | Very Poor (Blocks sales on disconnect) | Locked (No API extension for merchants) | High (Proprietary tablets / locked iPads) | High MDR (Forced partner channels) | Rigid templates only | Mid-market F&B, retail |
| **Majoo** | SaaS (IDR 3jt - 5jt / yr) | Poor (Limited offline mode) | Standard integrations only | Medium (Forced hardware bundling) | Fixed MDR commissions | Basic discount setups | General retail, service |
| **Qasir** | Freemium with paid add-ons | Basic offline | Zero customization | Low (Mobile-first, Android-only) | Commissions on digital payments | Minimal configuration | Micro-merchants (*warung*) |
| **Pawoon** | SaaS (IDR 2.5jt - 4jt / yr) | Medium (Offline mode with sync limit) | Limited (Preset API partners only) | Medium (Recommended tablet bundles) | Partner-channel payment MDR | Standard tax/discount templates | Small/mid F&B, retail |
| **Olsera** | SaaS (IDR 1.8jt - 3.5jt / yr) | Medium (Basic offline checkout) | Limited (Basic webhook access) | Low (Multi-platform app support) | Partner-channel payment MDR | Standard promo rule templates | Boutique retail, cafes |
| **ESB POS** | SaaS (IDR 6jt - 15jt+ / yr) | Good (Requires local hub server install) | Custom (Paid enterprise integrations) | High (Requires enterprise hardware) | Negotiated enterprise MDR | Complex templates (ERP-coupled) | Large F&B chains, fine dining |
| **OZ-POS** | **Five-Tier SaaS (Free / Plus / Pro / Premium / Enterprise)** | **Excellent (Offline-first SQLite engine)** | **Unlimited (Open source core + Lua scripting)** | **None (Runs on legacy Windows/Android/iOS)** | **0% app fees (Direct Midtrans/Stripe)** | **Dynamic programmable Lua VM engine** | Micro to Enterprise retail/F&B |

### 3.3 Ultra-Lightweight Footprint & Legacy Hardware Support (CAPEX Reduction)

A primary barrier to POS adoption for Indonesian MSMEs (UMKM) is the upfront Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) required for modern touch terminals. Many local merchants operate legacy checkout terminals or entry-level mobile devices. OZ-POS solves this by supporting ultra-low-spec hardware:

*   **Sub-50MB RAM Footprint:** Legacy Windows POS registers (e.g., ex-thin clients like HP T628 or generic POS terminals commonly sold on Tokopedia) often have only **2GB to 4GB of DDR3 RAM**. While Electron-based POS applications require **500MB to 1GB of RAM** (causing severe OS memory thrashing and slow disk swapping), OZ-POS runs on Tauri v2. By utilizing the OS-native webview (WebView2 on Windows, WebKit on Linux, WebKit/Safari on iOS) and a native Rust backend, memory consumption is kept **under 50MB of RAM**.
*   **Legacy CPU Optimization:** Budget POS hardware typically uses low-power, older x86 processors (such as the **Intel Celeron J1900 / J1800** or Atom D525) or entry-level mobile ARM chips (such as the quad-core **ARM Cortex-A53** found in budget Android tablets and older Sunmi V1/V2 handheld terminals). Because Rust compiles directly to highly optimized native machine code with **no runtime virtual machine and no garbage collection**, it avoids CPU spikes. Database read/write operations on SQLite execute in under a millisecond, preventing UI stuttering and input lag during peak checkout hours.
*   **Cellular-Friendly Installer (15MB):** Standard Java or Electron-based POS installers exceed 150MB–300MB. OZ-POS's native desktop installer is **under 15MB**. This allows field operators and merchants in rural or semi-urban areas to install and update the application via standard 3G/4G cellular modems or mobile hotspots without consuming high data quotas.
*   **Maximized CAPEX Protection:** Merchants can continue running their existing Windows 10/11 terminals or Android 8+ devices. By eliminating forced hardware upgrades, the customer acquisition friction is drastically reduced, enabling immediate software adoption.

## 6. Cost and Margin Analysis (OpEx vs. Edge Processing)

Due to the **local‑first edge database architecture** (SQLite processes >99 % of reads/writes directly on the terminal), OZ‑POS dramatically reduces cloud‑side operational expenditures while preserving a premium user experience.

### 6.1 Server Hosting & Network Load Comparison

* **Traditional Cloud POS Model:** Every item scan, transaction calculation, and report query triggers a cloud API call. Hosting expenses for databases and app servers therefore scale linearly (averaging IDR 15 000 / month / active terminal).
* **OZ-POS Edge Model:** Data is persisted locally; the cloud database is only contacted during compact outbox synchronization cycles. This yields > 90 % reduction in CPU and bandwidth usage, keeping cloud hosting and telemetry costs below IDR 1 200 / month / active terminal.

### 6.2 Detailed OpEx Breakdown per Terminal (5‑Year Horizon)

| Cost Category | Traditional Cloud POS (IDR / yr) | OZ‑POS Edge Model (IDR / yr) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Cloud Hosting & DB (CPU + RAM) | 180 000 (15 000 × 12) | 6 000 (500 × 12) |
| Data Transfer (Bandwidth) | 60 000 | 2 000 |
| Sync Service & Message Queue | — | 5 000 |
| Remote Monitoring & Logging | 30 000 | 2 000 |
| **Total Annual OpEx per Terminal** | **270 000** | **15 000** |

*Assumptions:* 1 000 active terminals, average 12 months of operation per year, conservative bandwidth pricing based on Indonesian ISP rates.

### 6.3 Margin Metrics (Conservative Estimates)

* **SaaS Tiers (Plus / Pro / Premium):** Gross margin **≥ 94 %** after accounting for incremental support, compliance, and continuous sync infrastructure costs.
* **Enterprise Tier:** Gross margin **≥ 94 %** (custom contract; dedicated hosting passed through at cost).

These figures deliberately err on the side of caution, using higher cloud‑cost baselines and lower margin expectations than initial projections. The resulting high‑margin profile underscores OZ‑POS’s suitability for price‑sensitive Indonesian MSMEs while still delivering a robust, offline‑first experience.

## 7. Regulatory and Security Compliance (Indonesian Market)

Operating a commercial point-of-sale system in Indonesia requires adherence to Bank Indonesia standards and local fiscal frameworks.

1.  **Dynamic QRIS Generation:** Integration with Midtrans enables the dynamically generated QRIS (Standard QR Code Indonesia) to be displayed on terminals, validating payments against the central BI merchant network instantly.
2.  **Local Taxation Engine:** The embedded Lua VM allows restaurants and retail outlets to dynamically configure PPN (Pajak Pertambahan Nilai) at the national 11% rate, PB1 restaurant tax (10%), and customizable local service charges dynamically without app store updates.
3.  **Encrypted Local Audit Trails:** Transactions stored in SQLite utilize `oz-security`'s AES encryption before sync logs are compiled, keeping sales audit records compliant with PDP (Personal Data Protection / UU PDP) data-residency provisions.
