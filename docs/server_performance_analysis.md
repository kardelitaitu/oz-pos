## 1. Executive Summary

> **Design principle: cheapest server wins.** Every architecture decision is evaluated
> through one lens: *how many POS terminals can we serve for $0/month?*

The OZ-POS server is a **single Docker container** running three processes under supervisord:

| Process | Runtime | Port | Role | CPU Cost |
|---------|---------|------|------|----------|
| Caddy | Go | 80 | Reverse proxy, TLS, gzip | ~0.01 core |
| License server | Go (PocketBase) | 8080 | Auth, license signing, billing | ~0.02 core |
| Cloud server | Rust (axum + tokio) | 3099 | Sync protocol, REST API, webhooks | ~0.05 core |
| **Total** | | | | **~0.08 core** |

At steady state, the three processes consume **~0.08 CPU cores** — well within the 0.2 core free tier budget. The remaining 0.12 cores handle burst traffic (concurrent sync pushes, webhooks, health checks).

**Key result: 200–400 active POS terminals on Northflank Free Tier ($0/month).**

The PostgreSQL addon (free on Northflank) eliminates the SQLite single-writer lock bottleneck. Every terminal gets its own async transaction — no mutex contention. Every optimization in this document is ranked by **cost-per-terminal impact**, not technical elegance.

> Docker builds always run on 4 cores / 16 GB RAM regardless of the runtime tier.

## 2. Architecture Deep Dive

### 2.1 Request Flow

```
Terminal (POS/KDS)
  ↓ HTTPS
Northflank Edge (TLS termination)
  ↓ HTTP :80
Caddy (reverse proxy + gzip)
  ├── /api/v1/license/*  → PocketBase :8080
  ├── /api/v1/*, /api/sync/*, /api/webhooks/*  → Cloud Server :3099
  └── /_/*  → PocketBase :8080 (admin SPA)
```

### 2.2 Cloud Server Middleware Stack

Requests pass through this pipeline (outermost first):

1. **Security headers** — `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, etc.
2. **Gzip compression** — `CompressionLayer::new().gzip(true)` for all responses
3. **CORS** — configurable origins via `OZ_CORS_ORIGINS`
4. **Concurrency limit** — API routes: 10 concurrent; sync routes: 40 concurrent
5. **Auth middleware** — JWT HS256 verification, extracts `ApiTokenClaims`
6. **Plan middleware** — gates `free` tenants when `OZ_ENFORCE_PLANS=1`
7. **Rate limit middleware** — per-tenant token bucket (sync) or per-IP (token minting)
8. **Handler** — actual request processing

### 2.3 Tokio Runtime

```rust
#[tokio::main(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 2)]
```

Two worker threads by default. This is adequate for the I/O-bound sync workload (most time is spent waiting on DB pool acquisition and network), but limits CPU-bound parallelism (JSON serialization, HMAC verification).

### 2.4 Database Backend

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Backend | PostgreSQL (Northflank free addon) |
| Connection pool | `deadpool_postgres::Pool`, 20 connections (`OZ_DB_POOL_SIZE`) |
| Tenant isolation | `SET LOCAL oz.tenant_id` per transaction (RLS-ready) |
| Schema | Auto-applied on first boot from `20260813_init.pg.sql` |
| Fallback | In-memory SQLite for unported handlers only (health is PG-aware) |

**PostgreSQL** opens a transaction per request, sets the tenant GUC for RLS, performs the INSERT, then commits. The 20-connection pool handles 20 concurrent writes without contention. Each terminal gets its own async transaction — no mutex, no waiting.

---

## 3. Cost Analysis

### 3.1 Hosting Economics

| Tier | Monthly Cost | CPU | RAM | DB | Max Terminals | Cost/Terminal |
|------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|---------------|
| **Northflank Free + PG addon** | **$0** | 0.2 core | 512 MB | PostgreSQL (free addon) | 200–400 | **$0.00** |
| Northflank Standard | ~$10/mo | 2 cores | 4 GB | PostgreSQL (larger addon) | 1,000+ | ~$0.01 |
| VPS (2 vCPU, 4 GB) | ~$12/mo | 2 cores | 4 GB | PostgreSQL (self-hosted) | 1,000+ | ~$0.01 |

**The free tier with PostgreSQL is the target.** Northflank provides a free PostgreSQL addon — no separate database service needed. At $0/month, the cost per terminal is literally zero.

### 3.2 PostgreSQL on Free Tier

The PostgreSQL addon is free on Northflank and eliminates the SQLite single-writer lock bottleneck:

- **No mutex contention** — each terminal gets its own async transaction via `deadpool_postgres::Pool` (20 connections)
- **Concurrent writes** — 20 terminals can push simultaneously without waiting
- **RLS-ready** — `SET LOCAL oz.tenant_id` per transaction, ready for row-level security cutover
- **Managed backups** — Northflank handles backups, no manual `cp` needed
- **Zero config** — just set `DATABASE_URL` env var, server auto-detects and switches

The only downside vs SQLite is ~1 ms network latency per query (vs 0 ms for local file). This is negligible for sync workloads.

### 3.3 Efficiency Principles

Every design decision follows these principles (in priority order):

1. **Minimize CPU** — The server runs on 0.2 cores. Every CPU cycle spent on compression, HMAC verification, or JSON serialization is a cycle stolen from serving terminals.
2. **Minimize memory** — 512 MB is plenty, but every MB used by the server is a MB unavailable for the PostgreSQL connection pool and OS buffers.
3. **Minimize I/O** — Fewer disk writes = longer SSD life = fewer upgrades. Batch writes, prune aggressively, compress responses.
4. **Minimize network** — Smaller payloads = less bandwidth = faster sync. Gzip compression, cursor-based pagination, snapshot caching.
5. **Minimize complexity** — Simple code has fewer bugs, faster cold starts, and smaller Docker images. Managed PostgreSQL over self-hosted, single container over microservices.

---

## 4. Sync Protocol Performance

### 4.1 Push (`POST /api/sync/push`)

- **Batch inserted in one transaction** (`push_batch`): UUID validation per item → INSERT into `offline_queue` → per-item outcome recorded
- On SQLite: one mutex lock acquisition for the whole batch
- On PostgreSQL: one transaction + one `oz.tenant_id` GUC for the whole batch; duplicates detected via `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING RETURNING id` (implemented — was one transaction per item)
- **Metrics:** `sync_push_duration_ms`, `db_connection_contention_seconds{handler="push"}`, `sync_pushes_total{outcome}`
- **Rate limit:** 100 pushes/min per tenant

**Note:** Inserts are sequential SQL statements within the shared batch transaction (the `for` loop keeps per-item outcomes). The per-item transaction overhead that made batches O(n) in round-trips was eliminated by `push_batch` — a 50-item batch is now 1 transaction, 1 GUC, 50 INSERTs, 1 COMMIT.

### 4.2 Pull (`POST /api/sync/pull`)

- **Cursor-based pagination** with 500 items per page
- Three query shapes: cursor, since-anchor, bare (full tenant dump)
- Returns `next_cursor` when a 501st row exists
- **Anchor expiry check:** if `since` is older than the 90-day retention horizon, returns `410 Gone` with `oldest_available` timestamp
- **Snapshot fallback:** when anchor expires, clients call `GET /api/sync/snapshot` for a full reference-data baseline (products + tax rates + users)
- **Rate limit:** 300 pulls/min per tenant

**Performance note:** The pull query uses `ORDER BY created_at ASC, id ASC LIMIT $5` which benefits from the composite index `idx_offline_queue_tenant_created ON offline_queue(tenant_id, created_at)` (plus `idx_offline_queue_tenant_status ON offline_queue(tenant_id, status)` for the pending-count query). Without these composite indexes, pull/status queries on large tables would full-scan.

### 4.3 Snapshot (`GET /api/sync/snapshot`)

- Returns all products, tax rates, and users for a tenant
- **In-memory cache** with 15-minute TTL per tenant (keyed by `tenant_id`)
- First call: `snapshot_all()` — products + tax_rates + users in a single transaction → serialize to JSON once → cache
- Subsequent calls within 15 min: serve the cached bytes directly (no DB access, no JSON re-parse)
- **Rate limit:** 50/min per tenant (expensive endpoint)

**Cache behavior:** The cache is an `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, (Instant, Vec<u8>)>>>`. Lock contention is minimal since the cache is only accessed at the start and end of the handler. The 15-minute TTL means stale data is acceptable (reference data changes rarely during a shift). Cache hits serve the stored `Vec<u8>` as-is with `Content-Type: application/json` — zero JSON processing.

### 4.4 Client-Side Sync Daemon

- **Base interval:** 30 s, randomized to 60–120 s per cycle (P-1 spec §Backoff)
- **Exponential backoff** on failure: `min(60s, 2000ms × 2^failures)` with full jitter
- **Three-phase cycle:** Read (DB lock via `spawn_blocking`) → Send (async HTTP) → Apply (DB lock again)
- **Tiered heartbeat:** server tells client how often to poll based on tenant count:
  - < 1000 tenants → 120 s
  - 1000–5000 → 300 s
  - 5000+ → `max(300, 10000/count × 60)` s

---

## 5. Rate Limiting

### 5.1 Sync Rate Limits (per-tenant, token bucket)

| Endpoint | Capacity | Refill Rate | Burst Handling |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `POST /api/sync/push` | 100 tokens | 100/min | Allows 100 rapid pushes, then throttles to ~1.67/s |
| `POST /api/sync/pull` | 300 tokens | 300/min | Allows 300 rapid pulls, then throttles to 5/s |
| `GET /api/sync/status` | 300 tokens | 300/min | Same as pull |
| `GET /api/sync/snapshot` | 50 tokens | 50/min | Allows 50 rapid snapshots, then throttles to ~0.83/s |

### 5.2 Token Mint Rate Limit (per-IP)

| Endpoint | Capacity | Refill Rate |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `POST /api/v1/tokens` | 30 tokens | 30/min |

### 5.3 License Server Rate Limits (per-IP, SQLite-persisted)

| Action | Limit | Window |
|--------|-------|--------|
| License activation | 5 attempts | per hour |
| Payment webhooks | Deduplicated via in-memory `sync.Map` | 24-hour TTL |

The license server's rate limiter persists bucket state to SQLite so server restarts cannot reset an attacker's rate-limit state (H2 audit requirement).

---

## 6. Capacity Estimation

### 6.1 Assumptions

- Average POS terminal syncs once per 90 s (randomized 60–120 s)
- Each sync cycle: 1 pull (50–200 items) + 1 push (5–20 items) + 1 status check
- Snapshot called once per terminal boot (cached for 15 min)
- License activation: once per terminal installation
- Average push payload: ~2 KB per item (JSON with product/sale data)
- Average pull payload: ~1.5 KB per item

### 6.2 Northflank Free Tier + PostgreSQL Addon (0.2 CPU, 512 MB RAM, 6 GB SSD)
> Docker builds always use 4 cores / 16 GB RAM; these specs are the runtime container.
> PostgreSQL addon is free on Northflank.
> **Cost: $0/month.** This is the target tier.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Concurrent sync connections | ~200–400 (20-connection PG pool + async) |
| Sustained sync throughput | ~100–200 sync cycles/s |
| Push items/s | ~500–1,000 (batched in one transaction per request) |
| Pull items/s | ~5,000–10,000 (read-only, PG handles concurrent reads) |
| Snapshot requests/s | ~20–50 (single snapshot_all query, cached 15 min) |
| Memory per connection | ~50 KB (tokio task + buffer) |
| Memory for 200 connections | ~10 MB (well within 512 MB) |
| PG pool overhead | ~30 MB (20 connections × ~1.5 MB each) |
| Total memory | ~60 MB server + ~30 MB PG pool = ~90 MB |

**Practical limit: 200–400 active terminals** on the free tier with PostgreSQL. The binding constraint is now CPU (0.2 cores), not database contention. Each terminal gets its own async transaction — no mutex, no waiting.

With the optimizations in §11.1 (remove duplicate gzip, extend cache TTL), the ceiling rises to **~400 terminals** — 5× the SQLite-only capacity at $0/month.

### 6.3 Standard Tier (2 dedicated CPU cores, 4 GB RAM, 60 GB SSD)
> **Cost: ~$10/month.** Only upgrade when free tier is exceeded.

Larger PostgreSQL addon + more CPU for higher throughput:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Concurrent sync connections | ~1,000+ (larger PG pool) |
| Sustained sync throughput | ~500–1,000 sync cycles/s |
| Push items/s | ~2,000–5,000 |
| Pull items/s | ~20,000–50,000 |
| Memory for 1,000 connections | ~50 MB (tokio tasks) + ~150 MB (PG pool) |

**Practical limit: 1,000+ active terminals** on the standard tier.

### 6.4 Scaling Thresholds

| Terminals | Monthly Cost | Backend | Key Constraint |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 1–200 | **$0** | PostgreSQL (free addon) | CPU headroom (0.2 core) |
| 200–400 | **$0** | PostgreSQL + optimizations | CPU + connection pool saturation |
| 400–1,000 | ~$10 | PostgreSQL (larger addon) | Connection pool + query latency |
| 1,000+ | ~$25+ | PostgreSQL + read replica | Write throughput, snapshot cache |

---

## 7. Bottleneck Analysis

### 7.1 CPU Bound (Primary Constraint on Free Tier)

With PostgreSQL handling concurrency, the binding constraint shifts to CPU (0.2 cores). CPU-bound work includes:
- JSON serialization/deserialization (push/pull payloads)
- HMAC verification (webhook signatures)
- JWT decode (auth middleware)
- Gzip compression (response encoding)

**Impact:** At 200+ concurrent terminals, CPU saturation causes response latency spikes.

**Mitigation:** Remove duplicate gzip (§11.1), reduce payload sizes, consider increasing tokio workers.

### 7.2 Connection Pool Saturation

The 20-connection PG pool (`OZ_DB_POOL_SIZE=20`) handles concurrent requests. When all 20 connections are busy, new requests queue in the pool.

**Impact:** Under burst conditions (20+ simultaneous sync pushes), requests wait for a pool connection. Typical wait: 5–20 ms.

**Mitigation:** Increase `OZ_DB_POOL_SIZE` to `2 × num_cpus + 1` (standard PostgreSQL tuning). On 0.2 core, 5–10 connections is sufficient.

### 7.3 Snapshot Cache Miss Penalty

When the 15-minute cache expires, the snapshot handler executes `snapshot_all` (products + tax_rates + users in one transaction) and serializes the result to JSON once. For a tenant with 1,000 products, this takes ~50–100 ms on PostgreSQL.

**Impact:** Every 15 minutes, each terminal pays a one-time latency penalty on its next sync.

**Mitigation:** The 15-minute TTL (implemented — was 5 min) is a reasonable trade-off: it reduces cache misses by 3× with minimal staleness risk for reference data.

### 7.4 Tokio Worker Threads

Two worker threads by default. CPU-bound work (JSON serialization, HMAC verification, JWT decode) competes with I/O-bound work (DB queries, HTTP responses).

**Impact:** Under high load, CPU-bound tasks may delay I/O task scheduling. Not a practical issue at <200 terminals, but could become one at 500+.

**Mitigation:** Increase `worker_threads` to match available CPU cores: `num_cpus::get()` or a fixed 4 for the standard tier.

### 7.5 Health Check DB Queries

The `/health` endpoint runs two async SQL queries on PostgreSQL (queue depth, last sync; the pool acquisition doubles as the ping) and three on SQLite (ping + depth + last sync). Under load, health checks share the connection pool with sync handlers.

**Impact:** Health check latency may spike if the pool is saturated. Docker healthcheck may mark the container unhealthy if the health endpoint takes >5 s.

**Mitigation:** Already mitigated by P8-3 (single lock acquisition for all health queries). Further: move health check to a dedicated read-only connection or use a lightweight in-memory ping.

---

## 8. Background Tasks

### 8.1 Prune Loop (Hourly)

- Archives stock_movements older than 90 days (batched: 50 rows per cycle)
- Deletes offline_queue items older than 90 days (batched: 500 rows per cycle)
- Runs in `spawn_blocking` to avoid blocking the async runtime
- **Impact:** Negligible under normal load. On large databases (>100K rows), the first prune cycle may take 10–30 s.

### 8.2 Email Report Sender (Every 300 s)

- Polls tenant settings for scheduled reports
- Acquires a Postgres advisory lock per tenant (serializes across instances)
- Generates analytics bundle (10 report queries) + builds HTML email
- Sends via SMTP (lettre async transport)
- **Impact:** CPU-intensive (analytics queries + HTML rendering). On PostgreSQL, advisory locks prevent duplicate sends across multiple container instances. Poll interval was reduced from 60 s to 300 s — reports are hourly, so a 60 s poll wasted CPU.

### 8.3 Rate Limit Cleanup (Every 5 min)

- Sweeps expired token buckets from the in-memory HashMap
- O(N) in number of active tenants, but tenants are cheap (one `TokenBucket` struct per tenant+endpoint)
- **Impact:** Negligible. Even 10,000 tenants × 4 endpoints = 40,000 entries, swept in <1 ms.

---

## 9. License Server Performance

### 9.1 PocketBase Under the Hood

- Go-based, single-threaded event loop (PocketBase uses `net/http` with default serve mux)
- SQLite for all data (license_keys, tenants, subscriptions, tenant_machines)
- RSA-2048 license signing (~1 ms per activation)
- HMAC-SHA512 webhook signature verification (~0.1 ms)

### 9.2 Activation Flow

1. Client sends hardware fingerprint + machine ID
2. Server rate-limits (5/hr/IP, SQLite-persisted)
3. Checks existing machine record (idempotent)
4. RSA-signs the license key (~1 ms)
5. Returns signed license + subscription status

**Throughput:** ~100–200 activations/sec on modest hardware. Not a bottleneck — activations are rare (once per terminal install).

### 9.3 Webhook Processing

- Stripe/Square/Midtrans webhooks are verified via HMAC (~0.1 ms)
- Subscription events update tenant plan in PocketBase (~5 ms)
- Payment events write `finalize_sale` to offline_queue for sync pickup (~2 ms)
- **Deduplication:** in-memory `sync.Map` with 24-hour TTL (resets on restart, but provisioning is idempotent)

---

## 10. Memory Budget

### 10.1 Free Tier (512 MB) + PostgreSQL

| Component | Estimated Memory |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Caddy | ~10 MB |
| PocketBase (Go runtime) | ~30 MB |
| Rust cloud server (base) | ~15 MB |
| Tokio runtime (2 workers) | ~5 MB |
| PostgreSQL connection pool (20 conns) | ~30 MB |
| Snapshot cache (200 tenants) | ~20 MB |
| JWT cache (1000 tokens) | ~1 MB |
| Rate limiter state | ~2 MB |
| Prometheus metrics | ~1 MB |
| OS + container overhead | ~30 MB |
| **Total** | **~143 MB** |
| **Headroom** | **~369 MB (72%)** |

The server is well within the 512 MB limit with PostgreSQL. The connection pool adds ~30 MB (20 connections × ~1.5 MB each), but this is well worth the concurrency gains.

### 10.2 Standard Tier (4 GB)

Same base memory + larger PG pool (~100 MB for 50 connections) + larger snapshot cache. Total ~300 MB, leaving 3.7 GB headroom for analytics queries and email report generation.

## 11. Implemented Optimizations

> All optimizations below are **implemented and deployed**. Each is ranked
> by CPU savings at 200+ terminals.

### 11.1 Per-Request CPU Optimizations

| Done | # | Optimization | CPU Saved | Extra Terminals | Where |
|------|---|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| [x] | 1 | Remove duplicate gzip | ~0.01 core | +20 | `main.rs:470` — removed `CompressionLayer`, Caddy handles it |
| [x] | 2 | Extend snapshot cache TTL | ~0.01 core | +40 | `sync_api.rs:357` — 300s → 900s (15 min) |
| [x] | 3 | JWT token caching | ~0.005 core | +20 | `auth.rs:34` — `RwLock<HashMap>` with 60s TTL, skips HMAC + base64 on hot paths |
| [x] | 4 | Skip UUID validation | ~0.02 core | +80 | `sync_api.rs:193` — `OZ_SKIP_PUSH_VALIDATION=1` env var, saves ~5µs × 20 items × 200 pushes/sec |

| [x] | 6 | Batch snapshot queries | ~0.002 core | +8 | `sync_store.rs:snapshot_all()` — 1 transaction instead of 3, saves 3 round-trips |

### 11.2 Background Task Optimizations

| Done | # | Optimization | CPU Saved | Where |
|------|---|-------------|-----------|--------|
| [x] | 7 | Email sender 60s→300s | ~0.001 core | `email.rs`, `email_pg.rs` — reports are hourly, no need to poll every 60s |
| [x] | 8 | Lazy rate limit cleanup | negligible | `rate_limit.rs` — skip sweep if <500 buckets |

### 11.3 Infrastructure Fixes

| Done | Fix | Impact | Where |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| [x] | Connection timeouts | Prevents server hang on DB failure | `db.rs` — 10s for pool.get, 10s for SELECT 1, 60s for schema migration |
| [x] | Health check retries | Survives startup race | `healthcheck.sh` — retries cloud server /health 3× with 2s delay |
| [x] | Caddy active health check | Avoids 502 during startup | `Caddyfile` — health_uri + health_interval on reverse_proxy |
| [x] | Supervisord startup | More time for Rust server | `supervisord.conf` — caddy startsecs 2→10, startretries=5 |

### 11.4 Summary: Free-Terminal Budget

| Done | Optimization | CPU Saved | Extra Terminals | Effort |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| [x] | Remove duplicate gzip | ~0.01 core | +20 | 5 min |
| [x] | Extend snapshot cache TTL | ~0.01 core | +40 | 10 min |
| [x] | JWT token caching | ~0.005 core | +20 | 1 hr |
| [x] | Skip UUID validation | ~0.02 core | +80 | 30 min |
| [x] | Reduce snapshot payload | ~0.005 core | +20 | 1 hr |
| [x] | Batch snapshot queries | ~0.002 core | +8 | 1 hr |
| [x] | Email sender + lazy cleanup | ~0.001 core | +4 | 10 min |
| | **Total** | **~0.053 core** | **+192** | |

With all optimizations implemented, the free-tier ceiling rises from **~200 to ~400 terminals** — a 2× increase at $0/month with PostgreSQL.

## 12. Monitoring Checklist

### 12.1 Prometheus Metrics (Available at `/metrics`)

| Metric | Alert Threshold | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| `sync_push_duration_ms` (histogram) | p99 > 500 ms | Push latency spike — likely mutex contention |
| `db_connection_contention_seconds{handler="push"}` (histogram) | mean > 100 ms | DB lock wait time too high |
| `sync_anchor_expired_total` (counter) | rate > 0.1/s | Clients falling behind 90-day retention |
| `rate_limit_429_total` (counter) | rate > 1/s sustained | Tenant misbehaving or brute-force |
| `health_check_failures_total` (counter) | > 0 | DB unreachable |
| `health_db_latency_micros` (histogram) | p99 > 5000 µs | DB under pressure |
| `sync_pull_row_decode_failures_total` (counter) | > 0 | Schema drift between server and client |
| `webhook_5xx_total` (counter) | > 0 | Payment state may be stale |

### 12.2 Docker Healthcheck

```
HEALTHCHECK --interval=15s --timeout=5s --retries=3 --start-period=30s
    CMD /app/healthcheck.sh
```

The healthcheck pings both `/api/health` (Rust server) and PocketBase. The cloud server check retries up to 3 times with 2s delay to survive the startup race (Rust server may take 10-30s on first PostgreSQL schema migration). If either service fails 3 times in a row (45 s window), the container is marked unhealthy and Northflank restarts it.

Caddy's reverse proxy also has active health checking on `/api/health` with 5s interval — when the Rust server is down, Caddy returns 503 immediately instead of trying to proxy and timing out.

### 12.3 Key Operational Signals

| Signal | Healthy | Degraded | Critical |
|--------|---------|----------|----------|
| Health endpoint latency | < 50 ms | 50–500 ms | > 500 ms or timeout |
| Sync queue depth | 0 | 1–100 | > 1000 |
| 429 rate (per tenant) | 0 | 1–10/min | > 10/min sustained |
| Container memory | < 300 MB | 300–450 MB | > 450 MB |
| SSD usage | < 50% | 50–80% | > 80% |

---

## 13. Build Environment

Northflank provides **4 cores / 16 GB RAM** for all Docker builds regardless of the runtime tier. This means:

- **Cargo build** (Rust cloud server): ~3–5 min with dependency caching, ~8–12 min cold
- **Go build** (license server): ~30–60 s (modernc.org/sqlite is pure Go, no CGO)
- **Dependency cache priming** (Dockerfile Cargo.toml → dummy build): ~2–3 min
- **Layer caching** is critical — changing only source files skips dependency download

The 4-core build environment comfortably handles the full workspace compilation. No build-time optimizations are needed.

---

## 14. Future Considerations

### 14.1 Product/Menu Images

Planned but not yet implemented. Images will be:
- Auto-resized to 512×512 px
- WebP format at 35–40% quality (~8–12 KB per image)
- Stored in a separate `product_images` table (or object storage)

**Impact:** Each image adds ~10 KB to snapshots. With 100 images per tenant and 50 tenants, the snapshot response grows by ~50 MB — too large for a single HTTP response.

**Recommendation:** Paginate snapshots when image count exceeds 50 per tenant, or serve images via a separate endpoint (`GET /api/v1/products/{id}/image`).

### 14.2 Subscription Tier Image Limits

| Tier | Max Images | Storage (WebP 10 KB each) |
|------|------------|---------------------------|
| Free | 100 | ~1 MB |
| Pro | 500 | ~5 MB |
| Enterprise | 2,000 | ~20 MB |

### 14.3 Horizontal Scaling

The current architecture is single-instance (SQLite mutex, in-memory cache, in-memory rate limiter). Scaling to multiple instances requires:
- PostgreSQL (already supported)
- Redis or similar for shared rate limiter state
- Distributed snapshot cache (or accept cache misses across instances)
- Advisory locks for email report sender (already implemented for PostgreSQL)
