# Retail POS Theming Audit — 2026-07-28

<!-- Audit stamp: 2026-07-28 · Buffy · status: DRAFT (awaiting fix cycle) · branch: 0.0.24 -->
<!-- Scope: ui/src/features/retail/RetailPosScreen.tsx + RetailPosScreen.css + sibling theme files -->

## TL;DR

`RetailPosScreen` does not participate in the global theme system. It declares a **shadow `theme` state** with its own localStorage key (`retail-theme` vs the global `oz-pos-theme-v4`), an outdated type set (`'light' \| 'dark'` vs the 3-value global `'default' \| 'light' \| 'dark'`), and an underscore-prefixed setter (`_setTheme`) that is never called. The component then writes `data-theme={theme}` onto its own `<div className="retail-pos">` sub-tree, creating a non-reactive scope that drifts away from the global `<html data-theme>` whenever the user toggles the global theme via `ThemeToggle`. Worse, the **POS-domain tokens it heavily relies on (`--color-primary-pos`, `--color-success-pos`, `--color-warning-pos`, `--color-bg-pos`, `--color-dark-bg-pos`, `--color-fn-key-pos`, `--color-dark-border-pos`) are RENDERED at the CSS level ~30 times but are DEFINED ZERO TIMES anywhere in `ui/src/`** — neither in `tokens.css` (`:root`, `[data-theme="light"]`, or `[data-theme="dark"]`), nor via runtime injection in `applyAccentPalette`. The CSS comment at RetailPosScreen.css:1–6 explicitly claims the POS tokens "live in that tokens file" but the claim is false.

Three compounding issues produce the user's observation: (1) shadow theme state that goes stale, (2) sub-tree `data-theme` mismatch with `<html>` scope, (3) undefined POS tokens that should exist in every theme variant.

## Findings — ranked

| # | Sev  | Location                                     | Issue (summary)                                                                                      |
|---|------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **P0** | `RetailPosScreen.tsx:166–172`               | Shadow `theme` state shadows global ThemeProvider; never updates reactively.                         |
| 2 | **P0** | `RetailPosScreen.css` × 30+ usages of POS tokens | `--color-primary-pos` etc. have **0 definitions** anywhere in `ui/src/` (CSS-level orphan refs). |
| 3 | **P0** | `RetailPosScreen.tsx:167`                   | Storage-key collision: `localStorage['retail-theme']` vs global `'oz-pos-theme-v4'`.                  |
| 4 | **P1** | `RetailPosScreen.css:1068`                  | Hardcoded `#000` literal in `.retail-low-stock-banner` border-bottom (token-compliance violation).    |
| 5 | **P1** | `RetailPosScreen.css:321 / 334 / 341`       | `hsl(var(--cat-hue, 210), 30%, 70%)` etc. — hardcoded lightness/saturation escape token rail.          |
| 6 | **P2** | `RetailPosScreen.tsx:166`                   | Type set is `'light' \| 'dark'`, omitting global `'default'`; setter never invoked (`_setTheme`).     |
| 7 | **P2** | `RetailPosScreen.tsx` (whole file)          | Zero `useTheme`/`ThemeProvider` imports — does not subscribe to global theme.                        |

## Finding 1 — shadow theme state (P0)

**Where**: `ui/src/features/retail/RetailPosScreen.tsx:166–172`

```tsx
const [theme, _setTheme] = useState<'light' | 'dark'>(() => {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem('retail-theme');
  if (saved === 'dark' || saved === 'light') return saved;
  try { return window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches ? 'dark' : 'light'; }
  catch { return 'light'; }
});
```

Why this is broken:

- **The setter `_setTheme` is never called** anywhere in the file (grep: zero call sites). The state is initialised from the OS preference on mount and then frozen — it is functionally a one-shot read of `prefers-color-scheme: dark` with a stale localStorage fallback persisted under a key the global ThemeProvider never sees.- **`data-theme={theme}` is set on multiple root wrappers** (the main `<div className="retail-pos">`, plus the wrapper divs that render SalesHistory, StockInquiry, TableManagement swap-ins — see `RetailPosScreen.tsx:692, 721, 750` for the three `data-theme={theme}` occurrences). This scopes a sub-tree's tokens under the *frozen* local value rather than the live global one on `<html>`.

  > **Resolved by [`972e4b0c`]:** Step A replaced the shadow `useState` with `const theme = useOptionalTheme()?.theme;` so all four `data-theme={theme}` sites now consume the same live global theme — there is no longer a frozen local value sub-tree.
- **Type set only contains `'light' | 'dark'`** while `ThemeProvider` exports `Theme = 'default' | 'light' | 'dark'` (see `ThemeProvider.tsx:24`). The two state machines never reconcile.

**What the user observes in practice**:

1. User opens retail POS at 09:00 with OS set to light. `prefers-color-scheme: dark` returns `false`, local state initialises to `'light'`. The screen renders in light mode.
2. User opens `ThemeToggle` (in the global shell) and switches app theme to `dark`. `<html data-theme="dark">` flips. Other screens re-theme via token cascade.
3. Retail POS does **not** pick this up. Its `<div className="retail-pos" data-theme="light">` is still light. Result: visual mismatch between retail POS chrome (light) and the rest of the app (dark).

## Finding 2 — POS-domain tokens defined zero times (P0)

The CSS at `RetailPosScreen.css:1–6` says:

> "POS-domain extensions (navy primary, bronzy warning, F-key yellow) live in that tokens file so retail-pos and the cousin tablet-pos keep a single source of truth. There is intentionally no local :root here."

This claim is **false**. Direct evidence:

```
ui/src/frontend/themes/tokens.css has 0 definitions of:
  --color-primary-pos
  --color-primary-pos-dark
  --color-primary-pos-light
  --color-success-pos
  --color-success-pos-darker
  --color-warning-pos
  --color-fn-key-pos
  --color-bg-pos
  --color-dark-bg-pos
  --color-dark-border-pos

applyAccentPalette() injects at runtime:
  --color-accent, --color-accent-hover, --color-accent-active,
  --color-accent-subtle, --color-accent-fg, --color-accent-dim,
  --color-accent-alpha, --color-accent-secondary,
  --color-accent-subtle-fg, --color-accent-hover-fg, --color-accent-active-fg
  (ui/src/utils/color.ts:129–139)
```

`-color-primary-pos` is referenced **30 times** in `RetailPosScreen.css` (lines 36, 40, 73, 122, 141, 161, 221, 270, 289, 296, 297, 335, 346, plus `color-mix(...)` variants). None of those references resolve to a defined CSS custom property — by the CSS spec they fall back to the property's initial value (or `unset` for substitutes like `background`), so:

- `<div className="retail-pos">` background falls to `transparent` (the `--color-bg-pos` lookup fails).
- `.retail-product-btn` border-top, hover/active backgrounds, outline fall back to defaults — category hue colour (`hsl(var(--cat-hue), 30%, 70%)`) inherits the parent `--cat-hue, 210` but the outer literal saturation/lightness are hardcoded (Finding 5).
- `.retail-cart-action-btn--pay` (success colour), `--void` (danger), `--discount` (info) and primary-pos highlights all silently miss their navy / green / red colours.

Peer audit screens in `__tests__/themeRegression.test.tsx` and `__tests__/colorContrastCompliance.test.ts` already encode an SOT model. Adding `--color-primary-pos` (etc.) as **unenforced design exceptions** is the only reason this regression stayed hidden from the theme-compliance test surface — the test doesn't track POS-only tokens because no POS-only tokens are *supposed* to exist as hardcoded escapes; the comment in `RetailPosScreen.css:1–6` is the only place that names them.

## Finding 3 — storage key collision (P0)

- `RetailPosScreen.tsx:172` writes **`localStorage['retail-theme']`**.
- `ThemeProvider.tsx:42` writes **`localStorage['oz-pos-theme-v4']`** (a different v4-suffixed key, deliberately versioned to invalidate pre-existing settings).

Two systems, one component ignored by the other, two storage entries that can disagree. App theme on `<html>` follows `oz-pos-theme-v4`; retail sub-tree follows `retail-theme`. A user who goes to Settings → Display → toggle theme updates `oz-pos-theme-v4`. Retail never notices — it still has the original `retail-theme` value (or `null`, which falls back to `prefers-color-scheme`).

## Finding 4 — hardcoded `#000` literal (P1)

`RetailPosScreen.css:1068`:

```css
border-bottom: 1px solid color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-warning-pos) 60%, #000);
```

Why this is wrong:

- The other 80+ colour references in the file are token-driven (`var(--color-...)`). This single `#000` is the only hardcoded hex in the entire file.
- It was likely copy-pasted from the existing warning-pos border styling; the original intent was probably "darken the warning-pos by 60%" — but the darken target should be **a token** that itself responds to theme, not `#000`, which is permanently black in light/dark/default theme equally.
- Documented register reference: this matches the `design-exceptions.md` "Adjustable" / "Hardcoded-Not-Allowed" pattern that the repo enumerates. The exception register (latest audit stamp: 2026-07-26) is the single source of truth for *why* a hardcoded escape exists; this `#000` is not listed there → outlier.

Replacement candidate: `color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-warning-pos) 60%, var(--color-ink))` or define a new `--color-warning-pos-edge` token.

## Finding 5 — `hsl()` saturation/lightness escapes (P1)

`RetailPosScreen.css:321 / 334 / 341`:

```css
border-top: 0.1875rem solid hsl(var(--cat-hue, 210), 30%, 70%);
background: hsl(var(--cat-hue, 210), 40%, 92%);  /* hover */
background: hsl(var(--cat-hue, 210), 40%, 82%);  /* active */
```

Why this is wrong:

- The `--cat-hue` hue *does* vary per category (good), but the lightness/saturation `30% / 40% / 70 / 82 / 92` are baked in. In a light theme the hover (`40%, 92%`) is near-white — fine for the background-elevated embedded inside a light-theme chrome. In the dark theme it would render as a near-white-on-dark hover (visible on dark surface) — but here the screen reads the dark-theme `--color-bg-elevated` would *flip* to the dark-theme value, and `hsl(cat-hue, 40%, 92%)` (no theme relation) would still render near-white, producing wrong contrast.
- Better: derive colours from `--color-bg-surface` and `--cat-hue` only — `color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-bg-surface), hsl(var(--cat-hue) 60% 50%) 18%)` — so lightness tracks theme tokens. Or expose `--color-product-idle`, `--color-product-hover`, `--color-product-active` triplets and define them per theme.

## Finding 6 — type set + dead setter (P2)

- The setter returned by `useState` is renamed to `_setTheme` (TS/JS convention: underscore prefix signals "intentionally unused"). However, this is **not** a valid "intentionally unused" pattern when the value is declared with `const` at the top of a public React component. ESLint rules (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` ignoring `_`-prefix) will silent OK, but the rendering consequence is real.
- The type `'light' | 'dark'` is **smaller** than the global `Theme = 'default' | 'light' | 'dark'`. The local state has no `'default'` representation; if the user toggles to `default`, the local state cannot mirror it.

Fix concept: remove the local `useState` entirely. Consume `useTheme()` from `ThemeProvider` and pass `theme` directly into `data-theme={theme}` on the root wrapper so the React tree mirrors the global theme one-for-one.

## Finding 7 — no `useTheme` / `ThemeProvider` import (P2)

`RetailPosScreen.tsx` imports nothing from `@/frontend/shell/ThemeProvider.tsx`. None of:

- `useTheme()` (live `{ theme, toggleTheme, setTheme }`)
- `useOptionalTheme()` (safe variant)

are referenced anywhere in the file. peer screens (`KdsScreen`, `SettingsPage`, `WorkspaceHome`) all subscribe to the global theme via `useTheme()` and reflect its value through the cascade — no per-screen shadow state.

## Architecture comparison — peer screens

| Screen                          | Local theme state? | useTheme? | data-theme attribute | Notes |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| `RetailPosScreen.tsx`           | YES (shadow)       | NO        | YES on `.retail-pos` divs | **the outlier** |
| `KdsScreen.tsx` (kds/)          | NO                 | YES       | NO                  | Uses global tokens via cascade. |
| `SettingsPage.tsx` (settings/)  | NO                 | YES       | NO                  | Scrollbar contrast handled at body. |
| `WorkspaceHome.tsx`             | NO                 | YES       | NO                  | Brand accent + theme both via context. |
| `PaymentModal.tsx`              | NO                 | YES       | NO                  | Modal backdrop uses `--color-bg-overlay` (themed). |

Retail POS is the **only POS-class screen** that maintains its own theme state besides subscribing to nothing.

## Risk assessment for users

1. App set to `light`, OS dark mode off: retail POS shows light chrome ✓ — but if `retail-theme` localStorage exists from a prior session it might still be `dark`, producing mismatched chrome vs rest-of-app on first render.
2. App set to `dark`, user toggles to `light` via ThemeToggle: retail POS still shows whatever it was initialised to (frozen).
3. Brand accent changes (Settings → Display → primary colour): `applyAccentPalette` repaints `--color-accent*` runtime and `applyThemeContrasts` reconciles fg. Retail POS does *not* receive --color-primary-pos at runtime (it's not in the runtime injection list) so its primary colour never updates to brand — it's keyed to whatever undefined value it has.
4. ThemeRegression test (`/__tests__/themeRegression.test.tsx`) does not render RetailPosScreen, so the orphan POS tokens don't fail the regression suite — silent visual drift.

## Recommendation — minimum diff for full fix

**Step A — [CLOSED via `972e4b0c`] Replace local shadow state with `useOptionalTheme()?.theme` consumption**:

  - _Implicit closure: deleting the shadow state also closes P0-3 storage-key shadow, P2-6 dead underscore-prefixed setter, and P2-7 missing-useTheme import. All four findings are satisfied by the same edit._

```tsx
// RetailPosScreen.tsx (where the local useState lives)
- const [theme, _setTheme] = useState<'light' | 'dark'>(() => { ... localStorage.getItem('retail-theme') ... });
+ import { useTheme } from '@/frontend/shell/ThemeProvider';
+ const { theme } = useTheme();
```

`useTheme()` already returns `Theme = 'default' | 'light' | 'dark'`. The `<div className="retail-pos">` `data-theme={theme}` continues to work, but now mirrors the live global value instead of the frozen initial one. **No other changes to the rendering tree are needed.**

**Step B — [CLOSED via `c888b142`] Add POS-domain tokens to `tokens.css`** in **all three** theme blocks (`:root` + `[data-theme="light"]` + `[data-theme="dark"]`):

```css
:root {
  --color-primary-pos: #1e3a5f;       /* navy */
  --color-primary-pos-dark: #14253d;
  --color-primary-pos-light: #2c5286;
  --color-bg-pos: #0d0d14;            /* matches default theme bg */
  --color-success-pos: #2e7d32;
  --color-success-pos-darker: #1b5e20;
  --color-warning-pos: #b7791f;
  --color-danger: #c62828;
  --color-danger-700: #8e0000;
  --color-danger-hover: #b71c1c;
  --color-danger-bg: #2a1010;
  --color-info: #1976d2;
  --color-info-bg: #0a1830;
  --color-fn-key-pos: #ffd54f;
  --color-dark-bg-pos: #06060c;
  --color-dark-border-pos: #1a1a2e;
  --color-fg-primary: #e0e0e0;
  --color-fg-secondary: #b0b0b0;
  --color-fg-tertiary: #808080;
  /* ...etc, light and dark variants override background tiles
     while keeping primary-pos palette stable across themes (POS brand-locked) */
}
[data-theme="light"] { --color-bg-pos: #f4f6fb; /* ... */ }
[data-theme="dark"]  { --color-bg-pos: #0d0d14; /* matches defaults */ }
```

POS palette tokens (`--color-primary-pos*`, `--color-fn-key-pos`, `--color-success-pos`, `--color-warning-pos`, `--color-danger*`) stay stable across themes (the navy/bronzy brand-locked identity). Surface tokens (`--color-bg-pos`, `--color-fg-primary`, `--color-fg-secondary`, `--color-fg-tertiary`, `--color-info-bg`, `--color-danger-bg`) flip per theme.

**Step C — [CLOSED via `c888b142`] Tokenize the `#000` literal**:

```css
- border-bottom: 1px solid color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-warning-pos) 60%, #000);
+ border-bottom: 1px solid color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-warning-pos) 60%, var(--color-ink));
```

Add `--color-ink` to each of the three theme blocks: dark navy in `:root`/dark, near-black in light.

**Step D — [CLOSED via `c888b142` + WKWebView fallback in `b274d860`] Convert `hsl()` lightness/saturation escapes to theme-aware colour-mix**:

```css
- border-top: 0.1875rem solid hsl(var(--cat-hue, 210), 30%, 70%);
+ border-top-color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-bg-surface), hsl(var(--cat-hue, 210) 50% 50%) 18%);
```

The hue remains per-category; the surface blend now tracks `--color-bg-surface` which *does* theme correctly.

**Step E — Runtime theme-sync guard for RetailPosScreen** so the orphan POS-token issue is caught by a rendered test going forward.

## Residual Risks

These items are out-of-scope for the initial audit closure but worth tracking:

- **Unremediated colour-mix sites — CLOSED**: The six additional `color-mix(in srgb, …)` uses in `RetailPosScreen.css` (lines 73, 83, 122, 141, 1594, 1844) now have paired solid-token fallbacks (`--color-bg-elevated`, `--color-primary-pos`, `--color-primary-pos-light`, `--color-success-pos`) using the same `/* P1-5 fallback: WKWebView <Safari 16.4 ignores colour-mix */` dual-declaration pattern introduced for the cat-strip sites. The previous `unset` worst case is replaced by a predictable solid colour on older WebKit engines, while modern engines continue to render the mixed overlay.
- **macOS ≤ 13.3 WKWebView floor**: `color-mix(in srgb, …)` shipped in Safari 16.4 (March 2023). Pre-13.3 macOS workstations fall back through the dual-declaration pattern but lose the hue-driven category blend; this is documented inline at the three cat-strip rules via `/* P1-5 fallback */` comments. New `color-mix` sites must follow the same dual-declaration convention.
- **Vite-virtual-URL trap for source-grep tests**: mitigated. Vitest transforms `.tsx` test files under a virtual URL (e.g. `/@vite-stub/…`), so any new source-grep test that uses `new URL('<rel>', import.meta.url).pathname` will resolve against the virtual directory rather than the on-disk path and fail with `ENOENT`. The Step E source-grep guard uses `path.resolve(__dirname, …)` (vitest polyfills `__dirname` for `.tsx` test files) — copy that pattern in any new source-grep test.
- **Theme-regression test coverage — CLOSED**: A runtime test in `ui/src/__tests__/RetailPosScreen.test.tsx` renders `<RetailPosScreen />` inside `ThemeProvider`, toggles the theme via `useTheme().setTheme('dark' | 'light')`, and asserts that the `.retail-pos` root's `data-theme` attribute stays in lockstep with the global `<html data-theme>` attribute. This closes the acceptance-criterion gap (previously called for `themeRegression.test.tsx`).

## Acceptance criteria for the fix

1. ThemeToggle (in `<html data-theme>`) and retail POS chrome (`<div className="retail-pos" data-theme>`) — when theme is changed — re-render in lockstep.
2. Retail POS primary colour tracks the brand accent palette (Settings → Display → primary colour) at runtime via a widened `applyAccentPalette` that also writes `--color-primary-pos*`.
3. The single `#000` literal is gone; the design-exceptions register only documents POS-specific brand-locked escapes if absolutely necessary.
4. `hsl(..., 30%, 70%)` / `40%, 92%` / `40%, 82%` are replaced with theme-aware colour-mix.
5. `__tests__/RetailPosScreen.test.tsx` mounts `<RetailPosScreen />`, flips the global theme via `useTheme().setTheme('dark' | 'light')`, and asserts that the `.retail-pos` root's `data-theme` attribute tracks the global `<html data-theme>` attribute. POS token resolution is guarded separately by `__tests__/themeRegression.test.tsx`, which includes `--color-primary-pos`, `--color-success-pos`, and `--color-warning-pos` in its theme-token resolution checks.
6. Cargo check + npm typecheck + eslint + vitest stay green.
7. Working-tree cleanliness: pre-existing dirty `LICENSE` and `docs/admin-guide.md` lines out of scope (no edits there).

## Open questions for the user

1. Should POS brand colours (navy primary, bronzy warning, gold F-key) be **theme-locked** (same in all 3 themes, preserves brand), or **theme-adaptive** (light theme uses desaturated variants for contrast)?
   - Brand-locked (recommended): POS keeps its visual identity in any theme; tokens stay brand-stable across themes.
   - Theme-adaptive: POS blends with the rest of the UI; primary colour shifts per theme.
2. Should `localStorage['oz-pos-theme-v4']` be **retired in favour of themed session** so that POS stops writing its own `retail-theme`? (yes, implicit in Step A — drop the local key entirely).
