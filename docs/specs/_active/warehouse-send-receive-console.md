# Warehouse POS — Professional Operations Console

> **Status:** Approved — decisions locked · **Area:** inventory, warehouse · **Version:** 2.0 (professional warehouse POS)

**Architecture rule:** each workspace type is independently evolvable. The warehouse workspace **copies** its UI structure from the retail POS (`features/retail/`) rather than sharing components — no imports from `features/retail/*` or `features/sales/*`. This keeps warehouse and retail-pos free to diverge without coupling.

**Backend rule:** reuse the existing Rust domains (`stock_transfers`, `purchase_orders`, `stock_counts`, `inventory_locations`, `products.barcode/rack_location`) and ESC/POS printing. Add backend only where a workflow genuinely needs new state (damage marking, pick-list status).

---

## 1. Goal

A **professional warehouse POS**: barcode-first, document-driven daily operations for inbound receiving, outbound picking/sending, cycle counting, and bin-level stock visibility — the warehouse equivalent of a retail POS, with the retail POS's speed and feel.

## 2. What exists to build on (no re-invention)

| Capability | Existing artifact | Reuse |
|---|---|---|
| Send/receive stock between locations | `stock_transfers` domain (draft → in_transit → received, partial receive) | Direct reuse |
| Receive against supplier purchase orders | `purchase_orders` domain + `receive_purchase_order` (updates inventory) | Direct reuse |
| Cycle counting | `stock_counts` domain (full / cyclic / spot → draft / in_progress → complete + adjustments) | Direct reuse |
| Barcode scanning | `useBarcodeScanner` hook (sales) — **copied** into warehouse | Copy + edit |
| Bin/rack per product | `products.rack_location` (ADR #36) | Direct reuse |
| Printing | ESC/POS `print_receipt` / `print_sales_receipt` commands + printer abstraction | Add warehouse print payloads (label, packing slip, receiving report) |

```

- **Barcode-first**: the top input is a persistent scan field; a hardware scan (or Enter) resolves the product and adds it to the session. The grid is a fallback for products without barcodes.
- **Session panel** is the "cart" — but it shows the active document (PO or transfer), line quantities, and per-line bin hints.
- **FnBar** mirrors the retail pattern (`warehouseShortcuts.ts` manifest + `WarehouseFnBar.tsx` + parity test).

## 4. F-key map

| Key | Action | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **F1** | `receive` | Incoming popup session — receive (PO or transfer) |
| **F2** | `send` | Outgoing popup session — pick + send |
| **F3** | `count` | Cycle-count popup session |
| **F4** | `stock` | Stock view (bin-level) |
| **F5** | `print` | Print menu (label / packing slip / receiving report) |
| **F6–F10** | *(placeholder)* | Reserved — rendered, no handler |
| **F11** | `fullscreen` | Global shell binding (already active for warehouse) — badge only |
| **F12** | *(reserved)* | Placeholder |

**Popup sessions** (F1/F2/F3): persistent floating mini-consoles that stay open until dismissed (Esc / ✕) and can be held open while switching to another task. F1+F2 can be open simultaneously (interleaved inbound/outbound day). Re-press focuses instead of stacking.

## 5. Workflows

### 5.1 RECEIVE (inbound)

Two receive sources, selected at session start:

**A. Receive against Purchase Order (supplier inbound)** — primary
1. Pick a PO (open/approved) → session pre-fills with its lines (SKU, expected qty, bin)
2. **Scan each barcode** → line highlights, staff enters/confirms received qty
3. Per-line **damage/quality marking**: `ok` / `damaged` / `short` (missing) — new state per line
4. "Complete Receive" → `receive_purchase_order` for the good qty + a stock adjustment for damaged/short (new backend: record damage on the PO line)
5. Auto-print **receiving report** (or queue for batch print)

**B. Receive against Stock Transfer (inter-warehouse inbound)**
1. Pick an in-transit transfer destined for this location (`list_in_transit_transfers_scoped`)
2. Scan lines, adjust `received_qty` per line (partial receive supported)
3. "Complete Receive" → `receive_stock_transfer_scoped`

### 5.2 SEND (outbound — pick list + verify)

1. Pick a **destination** (store/warehouse from topology)
2. Build the cart (scan or grid tap) — each line shows its **bin** (pick-from hint)
3. **Pick-verify**: as items are picked, staff scans each one against the cart → line marks `picked` (new pick-list state)
4. "Complete Send" → `create_stock_transfer` + `send_stock_transfer` (stock leaves, transfer → in_transit)
5. Auto-print **packing slip**

### 5.3 COUNT (cycle counting)

Reuses the `stock_counts` domain end-to-end:
- Create count (full / cyclic / spot) → scan or type counted quantities per line → complete → adjustments posted
- Warehouse console adds barcode-first counting UX on top of the existing `stock_counts` commands (existing StockCountsFlow screens stay for full management)

### 5.4 STOCK (bin-level visibility)

- Location-scoped stock table with **bin column** (`rack_location`) + search by SKU/name/barcode + sort + low-stock alerts
- Manual ± adjust preserved (audit path) — same as current WarehouseScreen, kept as this tab

### 5.5 PRINT

- **Product label**: single item → `print_receipt`-style ESC/POS payload (SKU, name, barcode)
- **Packing slip**: send document → lines + qty + destination
- **Receiving report**: receive document → lines + received/damaged/short
- Reuses the printer abstraction; new payload builders in the warehouse feature

## 6. Backend additions (minimal, only where workflows need new state)

| Addition | Why | Where |
|---|---|---|
| PO line damage/short state | receive workflow must record quality per line | `purchase_order_lines` + `receive_purchase_order` extension or a `po_receive_lines` table |
| Pick-list status on transfer lines | send workflow marks `picked` per line | `stock_transfer_lines.picked_qty` or status |
| Scan-lookup command | resolve barcode → product at this location quickly | existing product lookup suffices — verify before adding |

Everything else reuses existing commands — no backend change needed for the core send/receive/count flows.

└── register.tsx (kept)
```

**Retired:** the standalone `StockTransfersScreen` (form-based) is replaced by the warehouse SEND/RECEIVE console; the purchasing POs screen stays for PO creation, warehouse adds the receiving UX.

## 9. Phased delivery

| Phase | Scope | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| **P1 — Console + SEND/RECEIVE core** | `warehouseShortcuts` + `WarehouseFnBar`, console shell, scan input, session panel; receive against **transfers** + send with pick-verify (existing commands only) | None (foundations exist) |
| **P2 — PO receiving + damage marking** | receive against **purchase orders**, damage/short per line, receiving-report print | New backend: PO-line receive state |
| **P3 — Count** | barcode-first counting popup wrapping `stock_counts` commands | P1 console |
| **P4 — Print** | label + packing slip + receiving report payloads + dialog | P1 (ESC/POS exists) |
| **P5 — Stock tab + polish** | bin-level stock view, low-stock, manual adjust | P1 |

P1 alone delivers the "professional warehouse POS" daily flow for inter-warehouse movement; P2 adds supplier receiving; P3–P5 round it out.

---

## 10. Test level

- Vitest: `useWarehouseSession` (add/remove line, qty, mode switch, pick-verify state)
- Vitest: scan input resolves barcode → adds line; no-match shows toast
- Vitest: receive flow against transfer + PO renders and submits correct commands
- Vitest: damage dialog posts per-line state
- Vitest: F-key parity (manifest ⇄ FnBar ⇄ keydown; placeholders have no handlers; F11 shell-owned)
- Rust: new backend additions (PO receive state, picked_qty) get unit + integration tests; existing send/receive/count tests remain green

---

## 11. Resolved decisions

All six design decisions are **resolved** (2026-08-23) and locked into this spec:

1. **Popup concurrency — simultaneous.** F1 (Receive) and F2 (Send) popup sessions can be open at the same time, each holding independent session state; re-pressing a key focuses the existing popup instead of stacking. Interleaved inbound/outbound day is the normal warehouse workflow.
2. **Damage handling — inline per line, during receive.** Each received line records `ok / damaged / short` while scanning; good qty hits stock via the existing command, damaged/short quantities persist on the PO line (small backend addition: PO-line receive state) and optionally auto-generate a stock adjustment. Damage is captured at the dock, not afterwards.
3. **Pick-verify strictness — warn + manager override.** Complete Send stays disabled until `picked == qty` on every line (the daily discipline); a manager can override with a confirmation dialog that records who overrode and why. Not a hard block.
4. **Receive confirmation — toast + cart reset + print offer.** On complete: success toast with the document number, cart clears, and a non-blocking "Print packing slip? [Yes]/[No]" offer appears. No blocking success screen (matches retail's `retail-toast-sale-complete` pattern).
5. **Transfer number format — reuse existing `TRF-` numbers.** One document, one number across workspaces; the UI shows status + source columns for type visibility instead of encoding the workspace in the prefix.
6. **Grid vs scan-only — keep the fallback grid.** Scan input is primary and always focused; the searchable grid (name/SKU/barcode) sits below as the manual path for non-barcoded or unreadable items. Tap = same "add to session" as a scan.
