# RBAC centralized fail-closed enforcement gate

> **Status: IMPLEMENTED — 2026-08-11.** Shipped in two commits
> (`47fcf6a5`, `ef0707e1`); moved to `_done/`. See §10 for the completion
> record. The sections below are the original plan as approved.

## 1. Decision requested

Introduce the single backend `require_permission(permission)` gate that ADR
#35 D3 requires, migrate every permission-sensitive command onto it, and pin
the set of gated commands with a test so a new command that skips the gate is
caught by the suite. This is D9 step 2 and depends on the 0046 registry.

## 2. Evidence baseline

- Enforcement today is per-command `require_permission_for_user(store,
  user/role, permission)` — e.g. `apps/desktop-client/src/commands/authz.rs`,
  `customers.rs`, `exchange_rates.rs`, `loyalty.rs` (desktop and tablet).
- Rounds 172 and 174 found real gaps of exactly this class: `list_customers_scoped`
  resolved the session but skipped the `customers:view` gate (CRM-02), and
  `create_exchange_rate` skipped field validation entirely (CUR-05). The fixes
  landed per-command; the class of "command forgot its gate" is not prevented.
- Frontend gating exists in places and is presentation only.

## 3. Problem statement

A permission model is only as strong as its weakest command. With per-command
gates, "did every command gate itself?" is answered by review and by audit —
both of which missed instances. A single gate plus a pinned gated-command set
turns the question into a compile/test-time guarantee and gives ADR #35's
fail-closed rule one place to live.

## 4. Scope of the slice

### 4.1 The gate

`require_permission(permission)` on the backend resolves the caller's role
through the 0046 registry (family wildcards, sensitive keys, `"*"`), and denies
by default: an unregistered permission or an unresolvable role fails closed.

### 4.2 Command migration

Every existing `require_permission_for_user` call site moves onto the gate.
No command behavior changes; only the enforcement channel does.

### 4.3 Pinned gated-command set

A test enumerates the permission-sensitive commands and asserts each passes
through the gate. The list is explicit and reviewed — a new command must be
added to it, which is the review signal.

## 5. Implementation plan

1. Add the gate on top of the 0046 registry with deny-by-default semantics.
2. Write the failing test: a command that skips the gate is detected (Red).
3. Migrate the command call sites (Green), keeping round-172/174 tests green.
4. Add the pinned gated-command enumeration test.
5. Run area tests: `cargo test -p oz-pos-app --lib`, `cargo test -p oz-pos-tablet
   --lib`, `test-changed.sh`, fmt, clippy on both clients.

## 6. Test plan

### Existing tests (migration contract — must stay green unmodified)

- Round-172 `customers.rs` tests (desktop + tablet) and round-174
  `exchange_rates.rs` tests (desktop + tablet): they assert observable command
  behavior, so re-pointing the enforcement channel must not touch them.
- `commands::authz` unit tests — re-pointed at the gate if any assert on
  `require_permission_for_user` directly (implementation detail).

### New tests (Red first)

- Deny-by-default: an unregistered permission key denies; an unresolvable
  role denies.
- Pinned gated-command set: a test enumerates every permission-sensitive
  command and fails for one that skips the gate — a new ungated command is
  caught by the suite.
- The gate resolves family wildcards and sensitive keys through the 0046
  registry.

## 7. Security and correctness considerations

- The gate must be the only authorizer: a frontend role check never gates a
  backend pass, and no second parallel enforcement path is introduced.
- Resolution errors deny, never allow.
- Session resolution stays where it is today; this slice only centralizes the
  permission check (assignment scopes arrive in 0048).

## 8. Non-goals

- Branch/workspace assignment scopes (0048).
- Profile fields (0049) and caching (ADR #35 D7).
- UI redesign beyond removing frontend-only gating that exists.

## 9. Rollback plan

The gate wraps the existing checks; reverting it restores the per-command
pattern without data or schema impact. The pinned command-set test is the
canary — if it flags false positives (a gated command that was already
internal), the list is corrected deliberately, not broadened silently.

## 10. Completion record (2026-08-11)

**What shipped.**

- `Store::require_permission(user_id, required)` in `oz-core` is the single
  fail-closed authorizer (ADR #35 D3): the 0046 registry is the only
  vocabulary (unregistered key denies even the `*` Owner grant), and an
  unknown/inactive user or unresolvable role denies as
  `CoreError::PermissionDenied` (role-missing is a denial, never `Internal`).
- Both clients' `authz.rs` became thin wrappers mapping
  `CoreError::PermissionDenied` to the existing `AppError::PermissionDenied`
  wire shape — `kind: "permissionDenied"` unchanged, no UI contract change.
- The tablet's dead role-based `require_permission` (zero callers, a second
  parallel enforcement path) was removed per §7's "the gate must be the only
  authorizer".
- New `apps/desktop-client/tests/gate_audit.rs` pins the full gated-command
  census of both clients: every command module with its gate-call count and
  permission keys, bidirectionally. A new command module, a dropped gate
  call, or a changed key surface fails the suite and forces a deliberate,
  reviewed pin update. Every gated key resolves through its real constant to
  `is_registered` (renaming a constant breaks the match arm); raw
  string-literal permissions at gate call sites are pinned out of existence.

**Deviations from the plan.**

- The census pins at *module* granularity (gate-call count + key surface per
  file), not per command function: a new command inside an already-pinned
  module that adds a gate call changes the count and is caught, but one that
  silently skips the gate has no intent signal for the suite to detect —
  that remains review's job, documented in the test's module docs.
- The Red for the census was demonstrated with deliberately corrupted pins
  (wrong count, missing module), both caught; the registry-linkage assertion
  was initially written comparing constant names to registry values and
  self-corrected to resolve names through the real constants.
- Runnable verification was partially blocked by running app binaries
  (`oz-pos-app` via another agent's `cargo run`, `oz-pos-tablet` via
  `tauri dev`); area-scoped `--lib` suites ran normally, and the audit test
  was executed by running its built harness directly against current
  sources.

**Verify evidence.** Gate 8/8 (oz-core `db::staff` 50/50) · desktop
`authz`/`customers`/`exchange_rates` 56/56 · tablet 55/55 · `gate_audit`
3/3 · `cargo fmt --check` clean · clippy `-D warnings` clean on oz-core,
oz-pos-app, oz-pos-tablet · drift guard clean · enforcement sweep: zero
`.authorize()`/`has_permission()` callers in `apps/` and `modules/` outside
the gate.

**Commits.** `47fcf6a5` (feat: centralized gate + client wrappers),
`ef0707e1` (test: pinned gated-command census), `34464e79` (docs: spec
moved to `_done`).
