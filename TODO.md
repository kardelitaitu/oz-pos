## 🔴 P0 — Plugin Security (Lua Sandboxing)

**Goal:** Audit and harden the Lua plugin execution environment to prevent privilege escalation, data leaks, and DoS from malicious or buggy plugins.

### Background

The plugin system (`crates/oz-lua/`) allows Lua scripts to intercept sale events, modify cart totals, and trigger stock adjustments via `oz-plugin` and `oz-lua`. Currently:
- Plugins run in a standard `mlua` Lua VM with **no sandbox restrictions**
- `require` is unrestricted — plugins can load any LuaRocks module
- No CPU instruction limit is set
- No memory/heap limit is configured
- No filesystem access restriction (no `chroot` or seccomp)
- No network access restriction

### Checklist

- [x] **P0-1: Sandbox audit** ✅ — Report at `docs/security/lua-sandbox-audit.md`. Found 7 findings (3 critical, 2 high, 2 medium).
- [x] **P0-2: Permission manifests** ✅ — `Permission` enum with 8 variants, custom TOML deserializer, enforced at load time.
- [x] **P0-3: Resource limits** ✅ — Instruction limit via `HookTriggers::every_nth_instruction(100_000)`. Memory limit documented but not enforced (rlua limitation). 3 new tests, 48/48 pass.
- [x] **P0-4: Safe environment** ✅ — 11 comprehensive sandbox tests added: all 14 dangerous globals verified nil, safe globals confirmed working, 8 individual vector tests (require, package, load, rawget, rawset, collectgarbage, debug, module), and a multi-vector attack script that tries all 11 vectors safely.
- [x] **P0-5: Regressions** ✅ — Real example scripts tested end-to-end: discount_bulk (all 3 tiers), tax_overrides (5 SKU prefixes), validate_order (max qty, alcohol, duplicate, clean), and real example-discount plugin hook execution.

---

## 🟢 P1 — Offline-Sync Reliability

**Goal:** Improve conflict resolution during multi-terminal offline sync, add comprehensive integration tests, and harden error recovery paths.

### Background

The sync system (`platform/sync/`) uses cursor-based push/pull with exponential backoff. Current known gaps:
- No conflict resolution strategy for concurrent edits to same product/sale from different terminals
- No integration tests for the full sync lifecycle (enqueue → push → pull → apply)
- Batch splitting works but edge cases around auth expiry mid-batch are untested
- Snapshot import recovery path is untested

### Checklist

- [x] **P1-1: Conflict resolution strategy** ✅ — ADR-21 drafted at `docs/decisions/2026-07-20-sync-conflict-resolution-strategy.md`. Defines entity-type dispatch (version LWW for reference data, state-machine LWW for sales, CRDT merge for stock), conflict logging, and tombstone propagation. 7 acceptance criteria defined.
- [x] **P1-2: Entity-aware conflict resolvers** ✅ — Implemented ADR-21 entity-type dispatch in `platform/sync/src/conflict.rs`. Added `resolve_version_lww` (version integer comparison), `resolve_sale_lww` (status DAG: active→pending→completed→voided→refunded), `resolve_stock_crdt` (CRDT delta merge preserving both deltas), and `resolve_conflict` dispatcher. Wired into `lib.rs` `run_sync_cycle`. 31 tests (30 new + 1 preserved legacy) covering all resolvers + dispatch edge cases. All 48 platform-sync conflict tests pass.
- [ ] **P1-3: Conflict UI indicators** — Add visual indicators in the UI when sync conflicts are detected: warning badge on OfflineQueueScreen, conflict count in StatusBar, and a "Resolve Conflicts" sub-screen showing conflicted items with resolution options.
- [x] **P1-4: Snapshot import error handling** ✅ — 13 tests covering: empty snapshot, single/multiple products, missing SKU/name, idempotent re-import (ON CONFLICT upsert), product/user overwrite, corrupted product missing all fields, corrupted user with default role_id, out-of-schema fields ignored, 6-entity multi-type bundle, FK violation rollback, null barcode. platform-sync: 139/139.
- [x] **P1-5: Offline queue dedup hardening** ✅ — Added `enqueue_offline_dedup` (checks pending items by action+payload) and `SyncQueue::enqueue_dedup`. 11 new tests cover dedup, cross-terminal scenario, different action/payload, and re-enqueue after sync. oz-core: 1445/1445, platform-sync: 126/126.
- [x] **P1-6: Sync observability** ✅ — Added `SyncStatusSummary` struct, `Store::offline_queue_status_summary()` (4 SQL queries: GROUP BY status, SUM retry_count, MAX synced_at, MIN created_at), and `SyncQueue::status_summary()` wrapper. 9 new tests cover empty, seeded, lifecycle updates, multi-failed retry sum, serde roundtrip, debug output, and cross-queue scenarios. oz-core: 1450/1451, platform-sync: 139/139.

## 🟡 P2 — UI Performance Optimization

**Goal:** Profile and optimize the three most expensive renders: product lookup grid, KDS ticket board, and sales history modal.

### Background

Current UI test suite runs in ~19s. The product grid (ProductLookupScreen/RetailPosScreen) re-renders all items on every keystroke in the search bar. The KDS ticket board polls every 5 seconds. Sales history modals re-query the full sale on every open.

### Checklist

- [ ] **P2-1: Profile baseline** — Add React Profiler traces to ProductLookupScreen, KDS ticket board, and SalesHistoryScreen. Record baseline render times and re-render counts in CI test output.
- [ ] **P2-2: Product grid virtualization** — Replace flat product list with `react-window` virtualized grid (FixedSizeGrid for desktop, FixedSizeList for tablet). Render only visible products + 2 rows overscan. Expected: 40%+ reduction in initial render time.
- [ ] **P2-3: KDS polling backoff** — Replace fixed 5-second polling with adaptive interval: poll every 2s when tickets are new/unread, back off to 10s when idle for >30s, back off to 30s when idle for >2min. Add `document.visibilityState` check to pause polling when tab is hidden.
- [ ] **P2-4: Sale detail caching** — Cache sale details in a `Map<saleId, Sale>` after first fetch in SalesHistoryScreen. Invalidate on any status change (void, refund, complete). Avoid re-fetching the same sale on modal re-open.
- [ ] **P2-5: Memo audit** — Add `React.memo` to the top 10 most-rendered components identified by profiling: ProductCard, CartLineItem, KDSTicket, KDSTicketTimer, PaymentMethodCard, SearchResultItem, TransactionRow, ShiftSummaryCard, AlertItem, LocationOption. Verify with before/after render counts.

---

## 🔵 P3 — KDS Display Enhancements

**Goal:** Improve KDS screen usability with overdue escalation, sound alerts, and layout polish.

### Background

The KDS system (kitchen display) has multi-layout support (Focus/Kanban/Metro) but lacks overdue escalation (tickets don't visually escalate as they get older), sound alerts for new tickets, and layout parameter persistence.

### Checklist

- [x] **P3-1: Overdue escalation** ✅ — Progressive visual escalation implemented: green <5min (on-time), yellow 5-10min (amber border+pulse), red 10-15min (red border+shake animation via `kds-shake` keyframes), urgent ≥15min (gradient red background + `URGENT` badge + gradient top bar sweep). Updated `useTicketSla` hook thresholds, added `urgent` boolean, dual audio alerts at 10min and 15min transitions. TypeScript checks pass.
- [ ] **P3-2: Sound alerts** — Add optional sound notification when a new ticket arrives: short chime via `AudioContext` oscillator (no external audio file needed). One sound per ticket, debounced to max 1 sound per 5 seconds. Toggle in KDS settings.
- [ ] **P3-3: Layout persistence** — Save selected KDS layout (Focus/Kanban/Metro) per terminal to localStorage. Restore on reload. Add `lastLayout` to `KdsLayoutSwitcher` state.
- [ ] **P3-4: Ticket count badge animation** — Animate ticket count changes on column headers with a brief scale-up bounce (0.3s) when count increases, scale-down when count decreases. CSS-only via `@keyframes`.
- [ ] **P3-5: KDS settings panel** — Add a settings gear icon in KDS header that opens a popover with: sound toggle, overdue escalation time thresholds (slider: 3-15min), auto-acknowledge new tickets toggle, and display density (comfortable/compact).

---

## 🟣 P4 — Documentation & Compliance

**Goal:** Close remaining doc gaps: ADR status updates, missing `///` docs, skill-drift audit, and changelog completeness.

### Background

Several ADRs lack final "Implemented" status updates. The skill-drift-guard found minor drift. Some recently added modules lack full doc comments.

### Checklist

- [x] **P4-1: ADR status audit** ✅ — All ADRs reviewed. ADR-18 (Multi-Location Inventory), ADR-19 (Sale Deduction), ADR-20 (Payment-Capture) updated from Proposed → Implemented with completion dates. ADR-20 status.md created with 5/6 criteria verified (20-1 deferred).
- [x] **P4-2: Missing docs** ✅ — All three target files already have thorough doc comments. `cargo clippy -- -W missing-docs` confirms zero warnings across the entire workspace. No changes needed.
- [x] **P4-3: Skill-drift guard** ✅ — `detect.sh --report` found zero drift. All skills are in sync with the codebase.
- [x] **P4-4: CHANGELOG final pass** ✅ — All commits documented in [0.0.12]. No missing entries found.

## 🟤 P5 — Payment Gateway Hardening

**Goal:** Improve reliability and test coverage for payment gateway integrations (QRIS, Square, Stripe). Add webhook handling, idempotency keys, and proper error classification.

### Background

Payment gateway drivers live in `crates/oz-payment/src/drivers/` (qris.rs, square.rs, stripe.rs). Current gaps:
- No webhook signature verification for Stripe/Square
- No idempotency key support for payment retries
- QRIS driver lacks proper error classification (timeout vs declined vs network)
- Integration tests use sandbox credentials configured via env vars — no recording/replay for deterministic CI

### Checklist

- [ ] **P5-1: Gateway error classification** — Standardise error types across all 3 drivers: `PaymentError::Declined(reason)`, `PaymentError::Timeout`, `PaymentError::NetworkError`, `PaymentError::InvalidCard`, `PaymentError::Duplicate`. Map each driver's native errors to these types. Update `PaymentModal.tsx` error display to show human-readable messages per type.
- [ ] **P5-2: Idempotency keys** — Add idempotency key generation (UUIDv7) to every payment intent/create request. Store key with payment record. Retry same idempotency key instead of creating duplicate charges. Add `idempotency_key` column to payments table (migration 097).
- [ ] **P5-3: Webhook receiver** — Add a lightweight webhook endpoint in `oz-api` for Stripe/Square payment events. Verify webhook signatures using gateway secrets. Update payment status from `'pending'` → `'completed'` on `payment_intent.succeeded` / `charge.captured`. Re-queue `finalize_sale` on successful capture.
- [ ] **P5-4: Sandbox test recording** — Implement a `TestFixture` recorder for payment tests: run against sandbox once, capture request/response pairs, replay in CI. Add 3 integration tests per driver (success, decline, timeout) using recorded fixtures.

---

## ⚪ P6 — Hardware Integration

**Goal:** Improve reliability, auto-detection, and test coverage for physical hardware: receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, customer displays, and scales.

### Background

The HAL (`crates/oz-hal/`) supports USB, Bluetooth, serial, and TCP/IP devices. Current gaps:
- No automatic device discovery — users must configure port/address manually
- Printer driver (ESC/POS) lacks common commands: barcode printing, QR code, cash drawer kick
- No printer status polling (paper jam, out of paper, cover open)
- Mock drivers exist but are not used in UI integration tests

### Checklist

- [ ] **P6-1: Auto-discovery** — Add USB device enumeration (using `rusb` or platform-specific APIs) to detect connected printers, scanners, and scales by vendor/product ID. Show discovered devices in TerminalManagementScreen as selectable options. Fall back to manual config when auto-detect fails.
- [ ] **P6-2: ESC/POS barcode & QR printing** — Add `print_barcode()` and `print_qr()` commands to `escpos.rs` printer driver. Wire into receipt printing flow: print QR code (payment link) and barcode (receipt number) on each receipt. Add test with mock transport.
- [ ] **P6-3: Printer status polling** — Add `get_status()` to the printer trait returning: `PaperStatus(ok/low/empty)`, `CoverOpen(bool)`, `DrawerOpen(bool)`. Poll before every print job; warn user if paper is low or cover is open. Add mock status simulation.
- [ ] **P6-4: Receipt preview in UI** — Add a "Print Preview" modal in PaymentModal that shows a styled receipt rendering before printing. Include: store name/logo, line items, totals, payment method, QR code, barcode. Use CSS for layout, then send to printer. Add test.

---

## 🟠 P7 — Tablet/Mobile Experience

**Goal:** Polish the tablet client for Android/iOS deployment. Fix touch targets, add swipe gestures, optimize for small screens, and ensure offline resilience.

### Background

The tablet client (`apps/tablet-client/`) targets Android and iOS via Tauri mobile. Commands mirror the desktop client. Current gaps:
- No swipe-to-complete gesture on POS screen (users expect swipe to pay on tablets)
- Touch targets need 44px minimum — some buttons are still 32px
- No pull-to-refresh on order lists
- Keyboard avoidance (input fields hidden behind keyboard on mobile)
- Tablet home screen lacks KDS order count widget

### Checklist

- [ ] **P7-1: Swipe gestures** — Add `useSwipe` hook support to tablet POS flow: swipe left on cart → open payment modal, swipe right on payment modal → go back to cart. Use `touchstart`/`touchend` with distance + velocity threshold (min 50px, max 300ms).
- [ ] **P7-2: Touch target audit** — Scan all tablet-rendered screens for sub-44px interactive elements using `touchTargetSizing.test.tsx`. Fix violations in: product cards (add-to-cart button 32px → 44px), filter chips (28px → 44px), tab buttons (36px → 44px), settings switches (32px → 44px).
- [ ] **P7-3: Pull-to-refresh** — Add pull-to-refresh to SalesHistoryScreen, OfflineQueueScreen, and KDS ticket board using `@react-spring/web` gesture or native `touch` events. Show spinner + "Pull to refresh" / "Release to refresh" states.
- [ ] **P7-4: Keyboard avoidance** — Add `useKeyboardAvoidance` hook that detects keyboard open/close on mobile (via `visualViewport` API or focus change) and scrolls active input into view with `scrollMargin`. Apply to: PaymentModal (customer search), SettingsPage text inputs, StaffLoginScreen PIN pad.

---

## 🔘 P8 — Cloud Server & License

**Goal:** Harden the cloud server (`apps/cloud-server/`) and license server (`apps/license-server/`) for production. Add rate limiting, audit logging, and deployment docs.

### Background

The cloud server (`oz-cloud-server`) handles sync API, authentication, and metrics. The license server (Go) handles activation, renewal, and status. Current gaps:
- Cloud server has no per-tenant rate limiting (any tenant can DoS the sync endpoint)
- License server lacks machine-level revocation (can't deactivate a stolen device)
- No health check endpoint on license server (Docker healthcheck uses curl)
- Deployment docs for cloud server are incomplete

### Checklist

- [ ] **P8-1: Per-tenant rate limiting** — Add token-bucket rate limiter to `oz-cloud-server` sync endpoints: 100 requests/min per tenant for push, 300/min for pull. Return `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header. Use in-memory `HashMap` with periodic cleanup.
- [ ] **P8-2: Machine-level revocation** — Add `POST /api/license/revoke-device` endpoint to license server. Accept `machine_id` + `license_key`. Mark device as revoked in PocketBase. `GET /api/license/status` returns `device_revoked` for revoked machines. Frontend shows "This device has been deactivated" with contact-support message.
- [ ] **P8-3: Cloud server health endpoint** — Add comprehensive `/api/health` to cloud server: DB connectivity (ping), sync queue depth, last sync timestamp, uptime. Consumed by Tauri app's ConnectionStatus component. Add prometheus metrics export.
- [ ] **P8-4: License server Docker healthcheck** — Replace curl-based Docker healthcheck with proper Go HTTP client in `apps/license-server/Dockerfile`. Healthcheck pings `/api/health` with 5s interval, 3 retries, 10s timeout. Document in DEPLOY.md.

---

## 🟠 P9 — Reporting & Analytics

**Goal:** Expand reporting capabilities with visual charts, export to CSV/Excel, and more granular date-range filters.

### Background

`crates/oz-reporting/` provides menu engineering and metrics modules. `crates/oz-core/src/db/reports.rs` has daily/weekly/monthly revenue, heatmap, top products, and category breakdown. Current gaps:
- Reports return raw data only — no chart rendering on frontend
- No CSV/Excel export for any report
- Date range picker is basic (start/end string inputs)
- No comparison period (e.g., this week vs last week)

### Checklist

- [ ] **P9-1: Chart visualizations** — Add lightweight chart rendering (via Canvas 2D API — no heavy chart library) for: daily revenue line chart, category breakdown pie chart, hourly heatmap. Use `color-mix()` for theme-aware colors. Add to ReportingDashboardScreen.
- [ ] **P9-2: CSV export** — Add "Export CSV" button to every report view. Generate CSV from report data on the frontend (no server round-trip). Use `Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL` + `<a download>`. Include BOM for Excel compatibility with UTF-8. Add test verifying CSV content matches report data.
- [ ] **P9-3: Period comparison** — Add "Compare to previous period" toggle to revenue reports. Show current period vs previous period side-by-side with delta percentage and up/down arrow indicator. Calculate on frontend from existing data.

## 🔵 P10 — i18n & Accessibility

**Goal:** Complete Indonesian translation coverage, pass Lighthouse a11y audit, and harden Fluent bundle verification.

### Background

From `docs/i18n-todo.md`: 4 Indonesian bundles are byte-identical to English (gift-cards, purchasing, stock-counting, stock-transfers). The ROADMAP has 2 unchecked items: Lighthouse a11y score ≥ 90 and full i18n coverage. The theme token compliance scanner needs expansion to catch a11y violations.

### Checklist

- [ ] **P10-1: Translate 4 Indonesian bundles** — Translate `gift-cards.id.ftl`, `purchasing.id.ftl`, `stock-counting.id.ftl`, `stock-transfers.id.ftl`. Use `scripts/translate-stub.py --write` to scaffold, then replace `[TODO]` sentinels. Verify with `verify-bundle-parity.py` and `lint-i18n.sh`. Est: 2 hrs.
- [ ] **P10-2: Lighthouse a11y gate** — Add `lighthouse-ci` to CI pipeline. Set threshold: a11y ≥ 90, best-practices ≥ 80, SEO ≥ 80. Run on 5 key routes: POS checkout, Settings, Product Management, Sales History, KDS. Fix any violations before merging.
- [ ] **P10-3: Color contrast audit** — Audit all CSS files against WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Fix violations in: StatusBar (muted text on dark bg), CartPanel (line-item prices), Badge variants, KDS timer text. Add CI check via `contrast-colors` npm package or `axe-core`.
- [ ] **P10-4: Focus indicator audit** — Verify every interactive element has a visible focus ring (`box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 2px var(--color-accent)`). Audit all 30+ screen files using automated selector scan. Fix: dropdown options, settings toggles, tab panels, date picker fields.
- [ ] **P10-5: Screen reader UX** — Add `aria-live` announcements for: cart total changes, payment success/failure, shift open/close, sync status changes. Verify with `jest-axe` in existing test files. Add missing `aria-label` on icon-only buttons across all screens.

---

## 🟢 P11 — Shadow Banding Audit

**Goal:** Eliminate visible colour banding on all elevated surfaces by applying SVG feTurbulence noise overlay.

### Background

From `docs/TODO-shadow-audit.md`: 30 CSS surfaces use shadows (`--shadow-xl` through `--shadow-xs`) but lack the SVG noise overlay `dither::after` that prevents gradient banding. Currently only `.card`, `.staff-login-card`, `.modal-panel`, and `.noise-dither` are covered.

### Checklist

- [ ] **P11-1: Phase 1 — High-risk surfaces (15 items)** — Apply `.noise-dither` class or add CSS selector to noise overlay list for: WorkspaceHome (ws-grid-item), RetailPosScreen (6 modal classes), TableManagementScreen, SettingsPopup, LicenseActivationScreen, GiftCardsScreen, PromotionManagementScreen, ProductManagementScreen, PurchaseOrderForm, SalesHistoryScreen, ShiftManagementScreen, StockTransfersScreen, PaymentModal, PriceOverrideModal, DevToolbar. All use `--shadow-2xl` or `--shadow-xl`.
- [ ] **P11-2: Phase 2 — Medium-risk surfaces (6 items)** — Apply noise overlay to: PosScreen (3× `--shadow-lg`), RestaurantMenu, SettingsPage, ContextMenu, Tooltip, SettingsSelect. All use `--shadow-lg`.
- [ ] **P11-3: Phase 3 — Low-risk surfaces (9 items)** — Apply noise overlay to: MultiStoreDashboardScreen, MenuEngineeringScreen, ProductLookupScreen, KioskScreen, RetailPosScreen (sm variants), SetupWizard (×2), CartPanelFooterTotals, CartPanelLineItem, PermissionDenied.
- [ ] **P11-4: Noise overlay CSS refactor** — Extract the noise overlay into a reusable CSS class `.noise-dither` in `components.css`. Replace inline `::after` in individual files with the shared class. Add `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to remove overlay for accessibility.
- [ ] **P11-5: Visual regression test** — Add a visual regression test (`playwright` or `puppeteer`) that captures screenshots of each elevated surface and compares against baseline. Run in CI on PRs. Fail if banding is detected via pixel-diff threshold > 1%.

---

## 🔴 P12 — PCI-DSS Gap Closure

**Goal:** Close the 6 remaining PCI-DSS compliance gaps identified in the checklist (`docs/security/PCI-DSS_CHECKLIST.md`).

### Background

The PCI-DSS v4.0 checklist has several items marked "Planned" or needing implementation. Critical gaps: no key rotation policy, no incident response plan, no MFA, no daily audit log review notification, no security incident reporting.

### Checklist

- [ ] **P12-1: Key rotation policy** — Document and implement key rotation for `oz-security` Keyring. Add `rotate_key()` method that generates new key, re-encrypts existing KEK-wrapped data, and updates storage. Add 90-day rotation reminder via toast notification. Est: 2–3 hrs.
- [ ] **P12-2: Incident response plan** — Write `docs/security/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md` with: incident classification (P1-P4), containment steps, evidence preservation, notification contacts, post-mortem template. Integrate with audit log by adding `incident` action type. Est: 2 hrs.
- [ ] **P12-3: Daily audit log review** — Add `unreviewed_audit_events` count to dashboard screen. Highlight events marked `critical` or `security` in red. Show last-reviewed timestamp. Add "Mark reviewed" button for managers. Est: 2–3 hrs.
- [ ] **P12-4: Session timeout & lockout** — Implement automatic screen lock after configurable idle timeout (5/15/30/60 min). Require PIN re-entry to unlock. Store timeout preference in user preferences or settings. Lock screen shows blurred last screen + time. Est: 3–4 hrs.

---

## 🟡 P13 — DevOps & Infrastructure

**Goal:** Improve CI/CD pipeline speed, Docker deployment, and developer onboarding experience.

### Background

Current CI pipeline takes ~10 minutes. Docker compose exists but cloud-server deployment docs are incomplete. Developer onboarding requires manual dependency installation. No automated end-to-end tests against the full stack.

### Checklist

- [ ] **P13-1: CI pipeline optimization** — Profile CI build times. Implement: shared sccache between jobs, incremental cargo check (only changed crates), parallel vitest + eslint runs, dependency caching between workflow runs. Target: < 5 min for lint + typecheck + unit tests. Est: 2–3 hrs.
- [ ] **P13-2: Docker Compose for full stack** — Update `docker-compose.yml` to include: `oz-cloud-server` (Rust API), `oz-pos` (desktop client in X11/VNC for CI), `license-server` (Go), PostgreSQL (sync target), Redis (cache). Add healthcheck dependencies. Document in `docs/operations/docker-deployment.md`. Est: 3–4 hrs.
- [ ] **P13-3: E2E test suite** — Add Playwright-based e2e tests for the 5 most critical flows: complete sale (scan → add → pay → receipt), staff login with PIN, create product, open/close shift, settings change. Use Docker Compose for backend + test against real SQLite. Est: 4–6 hrs.
- [ ] **P13-4: Developer setup script** — Create `scripts/setup-dev.sh` / `setup-dev.ps1` that automates: install Rust toolchain, install Node.js deps, run `cargo check`, run `npm install`, run initial migration, seed demo data. Replace manual setup steps in `QUICKSTART.md` with single-command setup. Est: 2 hrs.

---

## 🟣 P14 — Mobile Build & Deploy

**Goal:** Successfully build and deploy the tablet client on Android and iOS, enabling real-world mobile POS deployment.

### Background

The ROADMAP lists both Android and iPad builds as unchecked. The tablet client (`apps/tablet-client/`) and touch-optimized UI are ready, but the actual APK/IPA builds haven't been completed. Requires Android SDK / Xcode setup.

### Checklist

- [ ] **P14-1: Android build pipeline** — Add GitHub Actions workflow for Android APK build: install Android SDK (via `android-actions/setup-android`), set up keystore signing (secrets), run `cargo tauri build --target aarch64-linux-android`. Output signed APK + AAB as release artifacts. Est: 3–4 hrs (requires runner with Android SDK).
