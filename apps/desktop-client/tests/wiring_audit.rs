//! Tauri v2 wiring audit — exposes duplicate command registrations
//! in the `generate_handler!` macro that would cause a runtime panic.
//!
//! This test also protects the Staff security boundary: legacy unscoped
//! staff commands must not be registered after audit/06 remediation.
//! Tauri v2 panics at runtime when duplicate command paths appear in the macro.
//!
//! This test parses the `lib.rs` source and asserts no duplicate entries
//! exist, preventing future regressions.
