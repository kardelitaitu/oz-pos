//! Redirect middleware for zero-downtime VPS migration (ADR #11).
//!
//! When the `OZ_SYNC_REDIRECT_URL` environment variable is set, all
//! requests to `/api/sync/*` return a `server_migrated` response so
//! POS clients automatically update their local `sync_server_url` and
//! reconnect to the new server on the next sync cycle.
//!
//! The redirect URL is read once at startup and injected via axum
//! [`State`] — no per-request `std::env::var()` call.

/// Returns HTTP 421 (Misdirected Request) with
/// `{"error":"server_migrated","new_url":"<url>"}` for all `/api/sync/*`
/// paths. The 421 status is intentionally chosen over 301/308 because
/// reqwest (and most HTTP clients) follow redirects automatically — 421
/// ensures the POS client's transport layer sees the response body directly
/// and calls `parse_server_migrated()` to update the local `sync_server_url`.
/// All other requests pass through unchanged.
