/**
 * ADR #45 §4.3 — the TypeScript validator and the Rust validator must not drift
 * on WHICH rules exist, not just on what a rule means.
 *
 * This test exists because the audit it encodes was originally done by hand, with
 * greps, over two rounds — and round 31's first pass produced "ten validation
 * rules exist only in the UI", which was wrong nine times out of ten. Four of
 * those were a regex too narrow to see a code emitted through a conditional
 * expression; three were enforced at another layer on purpose; two were rules the
 * backend enforces under a different name. A manual audit is a snapshot, and the
 * next validation code added would have made it stale silently.
 *
 * So: every code the UI can emit must either appear in the core validator, or
 * appear below with a named home and a reason. Both halves are checked, so an
 * exception goes stale the moment the core validator grows the check — which is
 * the direction drift actually happens in.
