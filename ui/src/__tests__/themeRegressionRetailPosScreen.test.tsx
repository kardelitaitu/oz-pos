// Step E (audit docs/2026-07-28-retail-pos-theming-audit.md):
// anti-regression source-grep guard for `RetailPosScreen.tsx`. The
// shadow-theme anti-pattern that caused the audit combined four
// typed-of-mistakes — a local-only `useState<'light' | 'dark'>`
// initialised from an opted-out localStorage key, a one-shot
// `prefers-color-scheme` read, an underscore-prefixed dead setter, and
// a missing import from the global `ThemeProvider` family. This file
// fails loudly if any of the four reappear, AND asserts the positive
// consumer pattern is still wired, so a future refactor that drops
// the global theme coupling fails in the other direction too.
//
// We deliberately run in the default happy-dom env (NOT node), because
// the project-wide test-setup.ts calls `localStorage.clear()` in a
// beforeEach and that would ReferenceError in a pure-node env. We
// lazy-import `node:fs` and `node:path` inside a per-test helper so
// the global setup runs first and the imports stay out of the env
// resolution path.

// under a virtual URL (e.g. /@vite-stub/…), so
// `new URL('<rel>', import.meta.url).pathname` resolves against the
// virtual directory rather than the on-disk one. The path via
// `path.resolve(__dirname, …)` resolves against the real on-disk
// location because vitest polyfills `__dirname` for .tsx test files.
