/**
 * Pick a store offset that provably shifts the UTC calendar day RIGHT NOW.
 *
 * Why this exists: an anchoring test that asserts "the UI shows the date for
 * store zone X" is only meaningful if zone X's calendar date actually differs
 * from UTC's at the moment the test runs. With a hardcoded +14:00 the assertion
 * is vacuous for ten hours of every day (UTC 00:00–09:59), because +14 has not
 * yet crossed midnight. That is precisely the "passes at some hours, fails at
 * others" property a regression gate must never have -- and a sabotage test
 * caught it in the R36-06 screens.
 *
 * Two offsets cover the whole clock:
 *   +14 differs from UTC whenever UTC hour >= 10
 *   -10 differs from UTC whenever UTC hour <  10
 * So exactly one of them always discriminates, and this returns it.
