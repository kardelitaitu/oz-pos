/**
 * Closes a single surface (modal, panel, pill) with a brief CSS exit
 * animation before calling the parent's close setter. Mirrors the
 * entry animation that brought the surface on-screen so the user
 * sees a coordinated fade-out instead of a snap to unmount.
 *
 * Per `.agents/skills/exit-animation-pattern/SKILL.md`:
 *   - Parent passes `open` (boolean state) and `onClose` (setter
 *     that flips it to false).
 *   - `requestClose()` is the dismiss handler: it sets `exiting=true`
 *     so the CSS mirror keyframe plays via the `--exiting` modifier
 *     class; after the fade, the hook calls `onClose` and the
 *     parent state flips, unmounting the gated JSX.
 *   - The host component renders the surface inside a gate of
 *     `shouldRender = open || exiting` so it stays in the DOM during
 *     the fade and the CSS keyframe actually runs.
 *   - `animDuration(ms)` returns 0 under `prefers-reduced-motion`
 *     so the surface snaps away as expected for users who suppress
 *     motion — no separate handling needed.
 *
 * Race semantics:
 *   - If `open` flips to false externally (parent bypasses the hook
 *     and unmounts directly), the surface simply unmounts as
 *     before — no fade. This is the intended behavior for
 *     "navigate to next state" flows (e.g. close-shift
 *     confirmation → success summary) where the new surface
 *     replaces the old one with its own entry animation, and
 *     adding an exit fade to the old one would visually double-up
 *     with the new entry.
 *   - If `open` flips back to true while `exiting` is still true
 *     (reopen during fade), the hook cancels the exit and resets
 *     `exiting` so the surface stays mounted.
 *   - Unmount during an in-flight exit: the timer effect's own
 *     cleanup clears the pending timer so we never setState on an
 *     unmounted component.
