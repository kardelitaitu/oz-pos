/**
 * Fluent message ids for inventory transaction types.
 *
 * The transaction table cell and the shift summary used to build these ids
 * with a template literal — `l10n.getString(\`inv-log-type-${tx.type}\`)` —
 * which silently produced `inv-log-type-purchase-order-receive` for the
 * `purchase-order-receive` type. That key exists in neither bundle, so every
 * PO-Receive row fell back to the humanized slug "purchase order receive" in
 * English *and* Indonesian, while the filter dropdown on the very same screen
 * (which names `inv-log-type-po-receive` literally) correctly showed
 * "PO Diterima".
 *
 * Template-built ids are invisible to scripts/verify-bundle-parity.py, which
 * can only resolve string literals, so no gate could catch this. Listing the
 * mapping explicitly makes it total — TypeScript rejects a missing union
 * member — and lets transactionTypeLabel.test.ts assert that every id
 * resolves in both real bundles.
