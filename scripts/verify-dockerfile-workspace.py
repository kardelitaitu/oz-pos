"""Verify the Dockerfile cache-priming stages cover every workspace member.

DOCKER-09: each Dockerfile (server and unified) manually copies every
workspace member's Cargo.toml into the builder stage to prime the
dependency cache, and creates dummy src dirs so `cargo build -p
oz-cloud-server` can resolve the whole workspace. If a member is added to
the root Cargo.toml but forgotten in a Dockerfile, the priming build
silently fails (it is best-effort) and the cache layer is dead weight —
every image build then recompiles the full dependency tree.

P2: the unified image (Dockerfile.unified) had drifted from Dockerfile.server
— missing oz-crypto / oz-media (both in cloud-server's dependency graph),
scripts/updater-compat-check (a workspace member cargo must resolve), and
four modules (giftcards/kitchen/promotions/purchasing — not in the
cloud-server graph, but cargo still parses every member manifest). Its
prime stage always failed, so every unified build paid the full compile.

This script parses the workspace `members` list from the root Cargo.toml and
asserts each member's manifest (or the inline dummy fallback for
apps/desktop-client and apps/tablet-client) is present in EVERY Dockerfile's
cache stage. A per-file exclusion set allows an image to intentionally omit
members it can still resolve — but the default requires the full list.
Exit code 0 = consistent, 1 = drift.

Usage:
    python scripts/verify-dockerfile-workspace.py
