scripts/verify-doc-uniqueness.py — Catch duplicate documents that both claim to
be authoritative.

WHY
===

`f3d9cca6` ("tidy up project root files into docs, dev, and scripts") moved the
repo-root `subscription-tiers.md` to `docs/records/` without noticing that
`28147fe4` had already created `docs/guides/subscription-tiers.md` two weeks
earlier. Result: two tracked files, same basename, **both stamped "Status: FINAL —
Single source of truth for tier pricing, quotas, and feature gates"**, whose
entitlement tables disagree:

    audit:view row          guides: present   records: absent
    White-label branding    guides: Pro+Ent   records: Enterprise only

Nothing in CI notices. `verify-ci-docs-drift.py` compares the CI manifest against
workflows and runners; it has no idea what a pricing document says. So the repo
can carry two contradictory answers to "what does a Pro customer get", and the one
an engineer follows depends on which file they open first. For a document whose
subject is what customers are promised, that is a business defect wearing a
file-management costume.

A reorg is a high-risk operation precisely because it looks mechanical: moving a
file into a directory that already has a same-named file is the one thing a
`git mv` does not warn about when the collision is created by the DESTINATION
already having a copy.

WHAT IT CHECKS
==============

  1. DUPLICATE BASENAME — two tracked files sharing a basename, where at least
     one is a document (.md). Reports both paths and how different they are.
  2. CONFLICTING AUTHORITY — those duplicates both contain an exclusivity claim
     ("single source of truth", "authoritative", "canonical", "supersedes") in
     their first 40 lines. Two files claiming to be THE source is the actual bug;
     a duplicate where one says "archive copy" is fine.
  3. IDENTICAL DUPLICATES — byte-identical same-basename files, which is pure
     drift with no content risk but still two places to update.

Exclusivity claims are matched case-insensitively and the check is line-limited,
because a document that merely mentions the phrase deep in a changelog section is
not claiming authority over the repo.
