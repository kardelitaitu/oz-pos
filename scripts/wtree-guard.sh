# scripts/wtree-guard.sh — detect concurrent edits to files you are working on
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# This repo is edited by several agents in ONE shared worktree. Two failure
# modes have already cost real time here:
#
#   1. Silent revert — another agent's `git stash` / `git checkout --`
#      replaced an in-flight file with HEAD. Nothing failed loudly; the
#      symptom was tests behaving impossibly (a fix that "passed" because
#      cargo re-ran a stale binary, or half a change set present).
#   2. Foreign hunks — `git commit -- <path>` commits the WORKING TREE
#      version of that path, not "your hunks". Someone else's in-flight
#      edits to the same file land in your commit. This produced a red
#      HEAD once and put one agent's fix inside another's commit.
#
# Both are drift between "I verified this file" and "I committed this
# file". This tool makes that window observable.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/wtree-guard.sh own   <file...>   # claim files, snapshot content
#   bash scripts/wtree-guard.sh verify            # stamp current content as tested-good
#   bash scripts/wtree-guard.sh check             # report drift since the stamp (exit 1 if any)
#   bash scripts/wtree-guard.sh status            # show what is claimed
#   bash scripts/wtree-guard.sh release           # drop the claim
#
# TYPICAL LOOP
#   wtree-guard own crates/oz-core/src/cache.rs
#   ...edit... ; cargo test ... ; wtree-guard verify
#   ...later...  wtree-guard check   # <- run IMMEDIATELY before committing
#
# State lives in $(git rev-parse --git-dir)/oz-wtree-guard, so it never
# appears in git status and is never committed.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT WIRED INTO .githooks/pre-commit
# It is tempting, but the claim file is per-REPOSITORY, not per-agent: if
# the hook enforced it, my claim could block another agent's commit for
# drift in a file they never touched. So it stays opt-in and the TDD
# skill tells you to run `check` immediately before you commit.
#
# It cannot prevent foreign hunks either — that is a property of
# `git commit -- <path>` committing the working-tree version of a path.
# What it does is shrink the window to a signal: if the file changed
# after your last verified run, you find out before the commit, not from
# a red HEAD afterwards.
