scripts/verify-agents-mirrors.py — Keep the three AGENTS.md mirrors telling the truth.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============

There are three copies of the agent rules: root `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/AGENTS.md`,
`.prime/AGENTS.md`. `.agents/AGENTS.md` documents the hazard itself:

  "scripts/bump-version.ps1 updates the *version* lines in these mirrors but
   nothing updates the *gate* list ... which is how all three drifted to different
   counts."

Counts drifting is cosmetic. **Claims going false is not.** Twice in 0.0.36 a
mirror stated something the repo contradicted:

  * `.agents/AGENTS.md` said "Steps 6, 7 and 8 have no CI backstop" after
    `13f2a1dc` put Go into `dev-ci.yml#static-gates`. An agent reading the mirror
    that governs work under `.agents/` would believe Go changes are unguarded.
  * root `AGENTS.md` said dev-ci "runs on every PR and push". It has no `push`
    trigger at all, so pushing a branch runs nothing.

Both were corrected by hand. This script is what stops the third occurrence.

GROUND TRUTH IS READ, NEVER ASSERTED
====================================

Nothing here hardcodes a version, a gate count, a step number, or which step is
Go. All of it comes from the repo:

  version        root Cargo.toml `[workspace.package] version`
  gate count     `^# ── <name> ─` section headers in .githooks/pre-commit
  which step is Go   the ordinal of the section whose text mentions `gofmt`
  what CI runs   job names in .github/workflows/*.yml (not *.yml.bak)
  CI triggers    the `on:` block of each live workflow

So bumping the version, adding a gate, or restoring a job updates the expectations
automatically -- and a mirror that does not follow is a finding.

WHAT IT CHECKS
==============

  1. GATE COUNT -- a mirror claiming N steps against a hook with M sections.
  2. FALSE CI COVERAGE CLAIM -- a mirror listing step K as "no CI backstop" /
     "local-only" when a live workflow actually runs it. This is the check that
     catches the bug class that motivated the script.
  3. MISSING COVERAGE CLAIM -- a mirror asserting CI runs something no live
     workflow runs (the inverse lie).
  4. COMMIT TYPES -- the documented `<type>` list must equal what
     .githooks/commit-msg actually accepts. A mirror omitting a valid type
     forbids work the gate allows.
  5. VERSION LOCK -- every mirror must carry the current version.
  6. TRIGGER CLAIM -- a mirror saying CI runs on push must match the workflows.
