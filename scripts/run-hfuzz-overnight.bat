REM  run-hfuzz-overnight.bat — launches the honggfuzz overnight campaign.
REM
REM  Two modes:
REM
REM    run-hfuzz-overnight.bat            launcher (default, double-click):
REM                                       starts the campaign in a MINIMIZED
REM                                       WSL console and returns immediately,
REM                                       so you can close this window and go
REM                                       to sleep. Closing THIS window does NOT
REM                                       stop the campaign — close the minimized
REM                                       console (or Ctrl-C / pkill inside WSL)
REM                                       to stop it.
REM
REM    run-hfuzz-overnight.bat foreground runs the campaign in THIS window
REM                                       with live output. Closing this window
REM                                       kills wsl.exe and stops the fuzzing —
REM                                       regular .bat behavior.
REM
REM  Both modes run fuzz/hfuzz/run_overnight.sh (the "run while you sleep"
REM  fuzzing campaign) inside WSL. Equivalent to:
REM
REM      cd fuzz/hfuzz && ./run_overnight.sh > /tmp/hfuzz-overnight.out 2>&1
REM
REM  Why a minimized console instead of `nohup ... &`? On WSL2, background
REM  processes are killed when the wsl.exe session that spawned them exits,
REM  so the launcher runs the campaign in the FOREGROUND of a minimized
REM  wsl.exe console (start /min). That keeps the WSL VM alive for the whole
REM  campaign and the .bat returns immediately. Keep the minimized window
REM  open; closing it stops the campaign. All output goes to
REM  /tmp/hfuzz-overnight.out.
REM
REM  Why WSL: honggfuzz does not build or run on native Windows — the whole
REM  fuzz/hfuzz/ crate is Linux/macOS/WSL-only (see fuzz/hfuzz/README.md).
REM
REM  PREREQS (once):
REM    - WSL2 with a distro that has Rust + `cargo honggfuzz` installed
REM      (Linux deps: build-essential binutils-dev libunwind-dev liblzma-dev)
REM    - This repo checked out on a Windows drive (the path is auto-converted
REM      to /mnt/<drive>/... via wslpath)
REM
REM  OVERRIDES (set in the environment before running):
REM    WSL_DISTRO        - WSL distro to use (default: the default distro)
REM    HFUZZ_RUN_TIME    - seconds per target (default 3600)
REM    HFUZZ_TARGETS     - space-separated targets (default: all)
REM    HFUZZ_THREADS     - fuzz threads (default: all cores)
REM    HFUZZ_REPORT_ROOT - campaign report root (default crash_reports/)
REM    HFUZZ_NO_NOTIFY=1 - skip desktop notifications (markers still written)
REM
REM  RESULTS:
REM    - campaign log:  /tmp/hfuzz-overnight.out (inside WSL)
REM    - crash reports: fuzz/hfuzz/crash_reports/<timestamp>/
REM    - next morning:  cd fuzz/hfuzz && ./triage_crashes.sh
REM
REM  DO NOT remove `pause`: the console closes on exit and hides errors.
