"""Apply an exact, asserted set of Fluent replacements to one file.

Every rule declares how many times its `old` text MUST appear; anything
else aborts the whole file with no write. This makes bulk i18n edits
reviewable: a silent miss (pattern drifted) and a silent over-match
(pattern too loose) both fail loudly instead of half-editing a screen.

Usage: python apply_i18n_patch.py <rules.json>
Rules: [{"file": "...", "rules": [{"old","new","count"}], "expect_absent": ["..."]}]
Paths are repo-relative and use forward slashes.
