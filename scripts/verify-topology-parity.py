scripts/verify-topology-parity.py — Keep the topology semantic contract and
its verdict corpus consistent across the Rust/TypeScript boundary.

WHY
===

The topology semantic contract (`topologySemantics.json`) is consumed by
BOTH sides of the IPC boundary:

  1. Rust — `crates/oz-core/src/topology.rs` embeds a VENDORED copy
     (`crates/oz-core/src/topologySemantics.json`) via `include_str!` so
     compiling the cloud/desktop server never touches the UI tree
     (`.dockerignore` excludes `ui` entirely).
  2. TypeScript — `ui/src/features/stores/topologyContract.ts` and
     `topologyCard.ts` import the ORIGINAL `ui/src/features/stores/
     topologySemantics.json`.

If a developer edits the contract on one side and forgets the other, the
Rust and TS validation engines silently disagree about the same topology
graph — exactly the class of drift this script exists to catch before it
reaches production. The `oz-core` unit test
(`vendored_contract_matches_ui_canonical`) enforces the same invariant at
test time; this script makes it enforceable from CI and `scripts/check.sh`
without compiling anything.

PHASE 2 — THE CORPUS (ADR #45 §2)
=================================

Byte parity proves the two sides read the same file. It does NOT prove they
compute the same answer from it, and that second gap is the one that actually
shipped a bug once (CHANGELOG.md:144 / JOURNAL.md:3953: same JSON, two
hand-written rule sets, different error contract).

So the contract also carries a generated verdict corpus,
`crates/oz-core/src/topologySemantics.matrix.json` — every (pairing row ×
source kind × target kind) combination, produced by the Rust evaluator. Both
evaluators assert against it: `topology_matrix_golden_matches_the_rust_evaluator`
in Rust, and `ui/src/__tests__/topologyMatrix.test.ts` in TypeScript.

This script cannot run either evaluator, so it enforces the corpus's SHAPE:
that it exists, tracks the contract's schema version, holds exactly one row
per pairing in contract order, probes every declared kind, and covers each row
with the full kind cross-product. A stale or truncated golden fails here even
in a context where neither test binary is available.

Regenerate the corpus deliberately:

    TOPOLOGY_MATRIX_UPDATE=1 cargo test -p oz-core --lib topology_matrix

USAGE
=====

    python3 scripts/verify-topology-parity.py     # exit 1 on any drift

EXIT CODES
==========

  0  — contract copies are byte-identical (or the UI copy is absent, which
       is legal in a server-only build context — oz-core vendors its own)
       AND the corpus is consistent with the contract.
  1  — drift detected; the output names the files to reconcile.
