scripts/dedupe-ftl.py — Deduplicates Fluent (.ftl) key definitions in
`ui/src/locales/`.

WHY
====

The consolidated i18n quality gate (in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, invoked via `scripts/lint-i18n.sh`)
flags any key that is defined twice within the same locale's joined
bundle. FluentBundle.addResource() emits `Attempt to override an
existing message` when the second definition arrives, and the FIRST
defined value silently wins. That is a real internationalization bug:
the duplicate key may exist because someone copy-pasted from the
canonical home file but the value drifts over time.

THE FIX
=======

For every key across the 48 .ftl + .id.ftl files in `ui/src/locales/`,
keep only the FIRST definition and drop every subsequent one (along
with its multi-line value continuations, attribute continuations, and
trailing blank-line paragraph separator). This guarantees:

  * Each key resolves to exactly one value (the first-wins semantic
    that FluentBundle was already running).
  * The gate's "Fluent key duplicates" check goes red → green as keys
    are consolidated into their canonical home file.

ALGORITHM
==========

Process the file line-by-line, but treat message *blocks* (not lines)
as the unit of dedupe:

  * A new block starts at a zero-indent line that is either a key
    definition (`keyName = ...`), a term (`-brand-name = ...`), or a
    comment (`# ...`).
  * Anything else (indented continuation, blank line, attribute
    `.attr = ...`) belongs to the previous block.

For each block, if its key has already been seen, drop the entire
block. Otherwise keep `lines[i:j]` where `j` is one past the last
continuation line in the block.

USAGE
=====

    python3 scripts/dedupe-ftl.py            # apply in place; prints a summary
    python3 scripts/dedupe-ftl.py --dry-run  # report what would change without writing

EXIT CODES
==========

  * 0  files are already clean (no duplicates) OR dedupe completed.
  * 1  a runtime error occurred (locales dir missing, no .ftl files, etc.)

LIMITATIONS
===========

  * Fluent `[[ Section ]]` group markers at column 0 are NOT recognized
    as block boundaries here. None exist in this repo today, but if you
    introduce them, this script will misbehave: a section header line
    will be treated as continuation of the previous block. Update
    `BOUNDARY_PATTERN` to match the marker before relying on
    section-grouped .ftl files.
