scripts/verify-ci-docs-drift.py — Catch CI documentation drift between
docs/operations/ci-pipeline.md, docs/releases/checklist.md, the workflow
definitions, and the local runners.

WHY
===

`docs/operations/ci-pipeline.md` is the canonical CI dashboard (AUDIT-27 CI-08).
When a job is renamed, removed, or moved between workflows, the docs
tables go stale and contributors trust a matrix that no longer matches
what CI actually runs. Likewise, `scripts/check.sh` (repository gate)
and `scripts/check-ui.mjs` (the `check:all` gate) are documented as
sharing a common gate vocabulary — if one drifts, "all checks passed"
means different things per entry point.

`docs/releases/checklist.md` also enumerates the live `dev-ci.yml` jobs by hand,
in the one place a release manager reads at ship time. It went stale the same
week the checker was made blocking, which is the argument for checking it rather
than trusting it.

Since AUDIT-27 CI-08 the gate vocabulary + status live in a SINGLE
source of truth: `scripts/gates.json`. This script derives everything
from that manifest and verifies, fail-closed:

  1. **Jobs:** every job name referenced in `docs/operations/ci-pipeline.md` (the
     Job Matrix and Pre-Merge Validation Gates tables) exists as a real
     job in `.github/workflows/*.yml`.
  2. **Workflow inventory:** every workflow file named in the Workflow
     inventory table exists on disk.
  3. **Gate vocabulary (manifest-driven):** every gate in
     `scripts/gates.json` is declared by the runners it lists
     (`check.sh` / `check:all` needles matched against the extracted
     labels). A manifest gate that no runner declares is drift.
  4. **Gate CI mapping + status (manifest-driven):** every gate's
     `ci.workflow`/`ci.job` reference exists, and the workflow honours
     the gate's declared status:
       * `required`            → the job must NOT have
                                 `continue-on-error: true`
       * `advisory`            → the job (or a step when
                                 `advisory_at: "step"`) MUST have
                                 `continue-on-error: true`
       * `required-on-push`    → the job's `continue-on-error` must be a
                                 conditional `${{ ... }}` expression
                                 (advisory on PR, required on push)

Workflow jobs that exist but are not documented, and runner labels
that no manifest gate covers, are reported as informational notes —
the docs/manifest are never stale in the fail direction.

USAGE
=====

    python3 scripts/verify-ci-docs-drift.py           # strict: exit 1 on drift
    python3 scripts/verify-ci-docs-drift.py --report-only   # always exit 0
    python3 scripts/verify-ci-docs-drift.py --verbose       # show OK rows

EXIT CODES
==========

  * 0  no drift: every documented job/workflow exists, manifest gates
        are declared and their status matches the workflows.
  * 1  a documented job is missing, a workflow file is missing, a
        manifest gate is undeclared, or a gate status contradicts its
        workflow.
  * 2  a runtime error occurred (docs, workflows dir, or gates.json
        missing/invalid).
