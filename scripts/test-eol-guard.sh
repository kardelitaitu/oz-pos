# Prove the pre-commit EOL net leaves alone what it must not touch.
#
# Two bugs, both found by reading the filter against .gitattributes rather than
# trusting its comment:
#
#   1. `*.bat text eol=crlf` -- the loop checked `text` but not `eol`, so it
#      stripped CRs from the WORKING TREE of batch files. The index storing LF is
#      correct (.gitattributes says so); the working tree is meant to be CRLF
#      because cmd.exe mis-parses labels/goto otherwise. Side effect: `git status`
#      reports the file modified with a zero content diff -- phantom M.
#
#   2. `* text=auto` makes check-attr answer "auto" for EVERY path, binary
#      included. Git's real binary sniffing happens later, inside `git add`. So
#      filtering on check-attr alone lets a PNG through, and `tr -d '\r'` then
#      deletes the 0D 0A in the PNG signature -- 1515 -> 1507 bytes on
#      apps/desktop-client/icons/32x32.png, signature destroyed, and `git add`
#      stores the mangled blob. Silent data loss behind a green hook.
#
# The guard is EXTRACTED from the hook, not copied, so this test cannot drift
# from the thing it is supposed to police.
