REM ============================================================================
REM  stop-hfuzz.bat - stops the running honggfuzz overnight campaign.
REM
REM  Signals the campaign inside WSL (via scripts/stop-campaign.sh) and waits
REM  for it to shut down gracefully, so the TERM trap can write a partial
REM  report + DONE marker into crash_reports/. Then closes the minimized
REM  "OZ-POS hfuzz overnight" console window, if it is still open.
REM
REM  Safe: only targets honggfuzz-related processes. It does NOT touch other
REM  WSL distros/sessions (Docker Desktop, other shells) or your dev server.
REM
REM  Usage: double-click, or run from anywhere (%~dp0-relative).
REM  Override: WSL_DISTRO=<name>  (only if you started the campaign with a
REM            non-default distro - must match)
