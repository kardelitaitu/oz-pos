.SYNOPSIS
    Robustly kill any stale process bound to a specified TCP port (default 1420).

.DESCRIPTION
    Called from start-desktop.bat before `cargo tauri dev`. Safely hunts down
    stale dev-server PIDs (typically a leftover `node` from a crashed `vite`)
    and frees the port so Tauri can bind cleanly.

    Hardening over the previous inline `powershell -Command` chain:
    - Per-PID try/catch (one unreadable/owned-by-SYSTEM PID does not abort
      the rest of the cleanup).
    - Filters to Listen|Bound states only — TimeWait/Established are left
      alone so we never tear down legitimate traffic.
    - Friendly coloured output per kill so port-cleanup's behaviour is
      visible in the console, replacing the previous silent no-op.
    - Exit 0 when clean (incl. nothing to do); exits 1 if any holder could
      not be terminated, so the .bat caller can surface a warning.

.PARAMETER Port
    TCP port to clear (default 1420 — Tauri's devUrl).
