scripts/verify-release-workflow.py — Statically validate .github/workflows/release.yml.

WHY
===

`release.yml` was renamed to `release.yml.bak` by 23c96330 with an empty commit
message, and nothing noticed that pushing a `v*` tag had stopped producing
installers (R36-11). A workflow that never runs cannot report its own breakage,
so it accumulates errors that only surface at the moment of a real release --
which is the worst possible time to discover them.

This script closes that gap for the parts that are checkable WITHOUT a tag, a
signing key, or a macOS/Windows runner:

  1. the file parses, and parses as a GitHub workflow with a `v*` tag trigger
  2. every `uses:` action is pinned to a full 40-hex commit SHA (CICD-05), and
     that name@sha pair appears in another workflow in this repo -- so a typo'd
     or fabricated commit is a finding rather than a tag-time failure
  3. every `scripts/...` and `install/...` path it invokes exists
  4. no residue from the docker matrix targets that were cut when this was
     restored desktop-only: a leftover `if: matrix.target == 'docker-cloud'`
     guard is dead weight, and an inventory gate demanding a `.tar` no job
     builds would fail every release
  5. the release asset inventory only demands extensions some matrix entry can
     actually produce
  6. a missing UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY still hard-fails. This is the one that
     matters most: an UNSIGNED updater manifest is worse than no release at all,
     because every client rejects it and the failure appears on a customer's
     machine rather than in CI. Checking that the secret is merely *mentioned*
     passed a mutation that turned the guard into `exit 0`, so the guard's
     branch is required to contain `exit 1`.
  7. job ordering (publish needs build needs validate) and least privilege
     (repo-wide `contents: read`; writes confined to release-publish)

WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE
========================

That a real tagged build produces working installers. That needs the actual
runners and key material. The complementary automated proof is
`dev-ci.yml#release-readiness`, which runs `scripts/check-updater-compat.mjs` --
that builds a Rust harness pinned to the minisign-verify version the real Tauri
updater client uses and proves signatures from `generate-latest-json.mjs`
verify, and that a tampered installer is rejected.
