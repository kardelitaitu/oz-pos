# Allowlist: commands that are intentionally unscoped.
#
# A `_scoped` variant buys two things, and both are the point of the rule:
# it authenticates a `session_token`, AND it resolves the *session's store*
# rather than the ambient `state.db`. Compare `get_daily_revenue` (locks
# `state.db`, no session, no permission check — anyone who can reach IPC reads
# any store) with `get_daily_revenue_scoped` (session + REPORTS_VIEW + the
# resolved store connection).
#
# So an entry here is a claim that one of those two does not apply. Three
# legitimate categories, and new entries should say which they are:
#
#   1. PRE-AUTH / BOOTSTRAP — no session exists yet, so a session_token cannot
#      be required. staff_login, has_users, bootstrap_owner, create_session,
#      verify_pin, activate_license, check_license_status, get_license_status,
#      get_machine_id, get_hardware_fingerprint, renew/pause/resume_subscription,
#      ping, version, get_device_id, get_local_ip, currency_info, test_auth_connection.
#   2. GENUINELY GLOBAL — the data is not per-store, so store scoping is
#      meaningless; the command still authenticates and checks its own
#      permission inline. This is the whole topology group: topology is a
#      global admin tool keyed by *branch*, and commands/topology/commands.rs
#      locks `state.db` 19 times and never resolves a store. load_topology,
#      can_save_topology, apply_topology_diff,
#      recover_pending_topology_apply_at_startup, and the four
#      *_topology_template commands — the latter added in d8209477 and missed
#      here until now, which is precisely the drift this gate exists to catch.
#      Also: settings_changed_sink, pick_logo_file, list_all_features,
#      set_feature(s)_bulk, get/rotate_key_rotation_info, export/import_data,
#      create_backup, get_backup_status.
#   3. HARDWARE / TERMINAL PATHS — device-driven, scoped by terminal rather
#      than store session: gateway_status, edc_terminal_status, edc_sale,
#      edc_refund, edc_void.
#
# The inventory/report entries are the long tail of the same reasoning.
#
# NOTE: adding a name here silences the gate for that command forever, and the
# list is a single regex alternation with no per-entry justification. Prefer a
# `_scoped` variant whenever the command reads or writes store data.
