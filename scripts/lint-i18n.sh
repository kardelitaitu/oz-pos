# scripts/lint-i18n.sh — local i18n quality gate.
#
# Runs as the `i18n Quality Gate` job in `.github/workflows/dev-ci.yml` — the
# only live workflow. It previously ran inside `ci.yml`, which 23c96330 retired
# to `ci.yml.bak` without a replacement; the step was restored after the Fluent
# page audit, because in between the only enforcement was the opt-in local
# pre-commit hook (core.hooksPath is set by scripts/setup-dev.ps1 and is not
# versioned, so a fresh clone gets no gate at all).
#
# Reports three categories of regressions. ALL THREE fail-closed
# (each drives the script's exit code):
#   1. `[i18n]` — translation completeness tests in
#      `ui/src/__tests__/i18nBundle.test.tsx` flag any .id.ftl file
#      that is byte-identical to its .ftl sibling (Indonesian users
#      see English text on those screens).
#   2. `Attempt to override an existing message` — FluentBundle
#      warns when two .ftl files in the same joined bundle define
#      the same key; the first loaded file wins silently, the
#      duplicate is dropped.
#   3. Parity: every literal Fluent key reference must have a
#      matching key in BOTH the en .ftl AND the id .id.ftl. Since the
#      Fluent page audit this covers `getString()`,
#      `requiredLocalized()`, `registerNavItem` i18nKey and
#      `SECTION_LABELS`, across features + components + frontend +
#      contexts + hooks + platform (see `--full-census` in
#      `scripts/verify-bundle-parity.py`). The rev-1 features-only
#      `<Localized id>` walk reported clean while 14 keys shipped
#      broken.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/lint-i18n.sh
#         (run from any directory)
#
# Exits 0 only when all three categories are clean; 1 otherwise, with a
# categorized error report on stderr.

# ── Pre-flight: bundle parity (FAIL-CLOSED since the Fluent audit) ───
#
# Sentinel-grep on the parity script's always-last stdout line
# `verify-bundle-parity: <N> missing key(s).` — robust to bucket
# renames / additions.
#
# Promoted from informational to a gate, exactly as the rev-1 comment
# prescribed ("Promote — once --report-only reports 0 missing — by
# dropping --report-only AND adding `exit 1` inside the `if grep -q`
# block"). The promotion is safe because the census reached 0 missing
# once the 14 phantom keys found by the page audit landed.
#
# Scope is now `--full-census`, not the rev-1 features-only
# <Localized> walk. The narrower scan reported "0 missing key(s)" while
# 14 keys shipped broken, because it could not see getString(),
# requiredLocalized(), registerNavItem i18nKey, or anything outside
# ui/src/features/** — including the shared chrome every page renders.
