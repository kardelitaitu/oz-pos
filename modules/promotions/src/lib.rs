findings: clean documented STUB — kernel registration + sales dependency only; promotion path documented (repository, rule engine in service keeping Money minor units, cart-before-tax evaluation matching foundation Cart ordering); promotions-engine feature flag depends on discount-engine; sibling tests file per convention

//! Promotions Module — discount rules and campaign evaluation.
//!
//! Owns promotion definitions (buy-X-get-Y, percentage off, fixed amount
//! off, time-limited campaigns) and the cart-time evaluation that turns a
//! matching rule into a discount line.
//!
//! Key types: [`PromotionsModule`] (kernel lifecycle), [`PromotionsError`].
//!
//! ## Stub status
//!
//! This is a **stub**: it registers with the kernel, declares its
//! dependency on `sales`, and logs its lifecycle transitions. The rule
//! engine still lives in `oz-core` and the management screen in
//! `ui/src/features/`. The `promotions-engine` feature flag already gates
//! the capability and itself depends on `discount-engine`.
//!
//! Promotion path — see `modules/README.md`:
//! 1. Move promotion tables and queries into `repository.rs`.
//! 2. Move rule matching and discount computation into `service.rs`,
//!    keeping every amount in `Money` minor units.
//! 3. Evaluate against the cart before tax, matching `foundation::Cart`
//!    ordering rules.
