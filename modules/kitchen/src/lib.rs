//! Kitchen Module — order firing, KDS tickets, and prep routing.
//!
//! Owns the restaurant back-of-house flow: firing an order to a station,
//! the KDS ticket queue and bump, course and table routing, and prep SLA
//! tracking for overdue escalation.
//!
//! Key types: [`KitchenModule`] (kernel lifecycle), [`KitchenError`].
//!
//! ## Stub status
//!
//! This is a **stub**: it registers with the kernel, declares its
//! dependencies, and logs its lifecycle transitions. The KDS today is
//! frontend-only (`KdsScreen` plus the LAN sync path in `platform/sync`)
//! with no Rust module owning ticket state. The `kitchen-display` and
//! `table-management` feature flags already gate the capability, and both
//! depend on `restaurant`.
//!
//! Note the existing runtime coupling: `oz_core::features` enforces a
//! disable guard that refuses to turn `kitchen-display` off while KDS
//! tickets are open. When this stub is promoted, that guard should consult
//! this module rather than reaching into `oz-core` tables directly.
//!
//! Promotion path — see `modules/README.md`:
//! 1. Move ticket tables and queries into `repository.rs`.
//! 2. Subscribe to `order.fired` in `on_load` so tickets are created by
//!    event rather than by a direct call from the POS screen.
//! 3. Move the overdue/SLA escalation timer into `on_start`, and cancel it
//!    in `on_stop` so a stopped module leaves no live timer behind.
