The body Locale row was always correct (lists only customers.ftl) · 31-08 (cont): noted the crate's CrmRepository/CrmService are a not-yet-wired mirror (no boundary_contract, not the runtime path) — L28 updated to say so (previously only claimed files 'remain in their original locations'); lifecycle hooks are stubs but the README's generic phrasing matches their log messages, so left as-is -->

# CRM Module

**Status:** Active (Phase 2.4 — Proof of Concept)

## Overview

The CRM module owns the customer relationship management vertical. It handles customer CRUD (create, read, update, delete), loyalty points tracking, and purchase history.

## Module Info

| Field        | Value        |
|--------------|--------------|
| ID           | `crm`        |
| Version      | `1.0.0`      |
| Dependencies | `[]`         |
| Permissions  | `crm:view`, `crm:edit` |

## Currently Owns

- **Backend** — Customer CRUD (`crates/oz-core/src/db/customers.rs`)
- **Commands** — Customer Tauri commands (`apps/desktop-client/src/commands/customers.rs`)
- **Frontend** — Customer management screen (`ui/src/features/customers/`)
- **API** — TypeScript API client (`ui/src/api/customers.ts`)
- **Locale** — Fluent translation strings (`ui/src/locales/customers.ftl`)

In the current phase the runtime customer CRUD still runs through the files above (notably `crates/oz-core/src/db/customers.rs`). The crate also contains `repository.rs` (`CrmRepository`) and `service.rs` (`CrmService`) as a not-yet-wired mirror (no `tests/boundary_contract.rs`), so the module remains a thin wrapper over the `oz-core` implementation. A subsequent phase will move the implementation fully into `modules/crm/`.

## Lifecycle

The module implements `foundation::contracts::Module` and follows the standard lifecycle:

1. **`on_load`** — Validates configuration
2. **`on_start`** — Prepares for customer operations
3. **`on_stop`** — Cleans up resources

## Registration

Registered with the kernel during application setup:

```rust
use modules_crm::CrmModule;
use platform_kernel::Kernel;

let mut kernel = Kernel::new();
kernel.register(Box::new(CrmModule::new()))?;
kernel.load_all()?;
kernel.start_all()?;
```

## Manifest

```json
{
  "id": "crm",
  "name": "CRM",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": [],
  "permissions": ["crm:view", "crm:edit"]
}
```
