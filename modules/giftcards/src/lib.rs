crate: modules-giftcards | status: SAFE | lint: CLEAN
findings: clean documented STUB correcting misplaced ownership (GiftCard types currently re-exported from modules/loyalty; move here on promotion with one-release re-export); kernel registration + sales dependency; promotion path documents tx-scoped issuance/redemption so a partial redeem can never leave a card debited without a matching sale line; gift-cards feature flag gates capability; sibling tests per convention
next: none (promote GiftCard types when built; remember MSL-10 pin redaction at the same time) | perf: N/A

//! Gift Cards Module — issuance, balances, and redemption.
//!
//! Owns gift-card instruments: issuance, stored balance in `Money` minor
//! units, partial redemption against a sale, and per-card transaction
//! history.
//!
//! Key types: [`GiftCardsModule`] (kernel lifecycle), [`GiftCardsError`].
//!
//! ## Stub status
//!
//! This is a **stub**, and it exists to correct a misplaced ownership: the
//! `GiftCard`, `GiftCardFilter`, `GiftCardTransaction`,
//! `GiftCardWithTransactions`, `IssueGiftCardInput`, and
//! `RedeemGiftCardResult` types are currently re-exported from
//! `modules/loyalty`, which is a different vertical (points and tiers, not
//! stored-value instruments). Those types move here when the stub is
//! promoted. The `gift-cards` feature flag already gates the capability.
//!
//! Promotion path — see `modules/README.md`:
//! 1. Move the `GiftCard*` types from `modules/loyalty/src/models.rs` into
//!    this crate's `models.rs`, re-exporting from loyalty for one release.
//! 2. Move card tables and queries into `repository.rs`.
//! 3. Put issuance and redemption in `service.rs` inside a single
//!    transaction so a partial redeem can never leave a card debited
//!    without a matching sale line.
