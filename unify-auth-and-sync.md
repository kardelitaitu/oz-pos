### Problems

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Two databases** | License data (PocketBase) and sync data (SQLite) are isolated — the sync plan gate reads its own `tenant_plans` copy, not the license server's tier |
| **Two credential systems** | The license server authenticates with a persistent tenant `api_key`; the cloud server mints short-lived HS256 JWTs via `POST /api/v1/tokens`. The POS holds both. |
| **No shared tenant registry** | The license server owns `tenants`; the cloud server has no `tenants` table — tenant identity is a loose `tenant_id` string column on many tables (default `'default'`), so the two can silently disagree |
| **Duplicated plan state** | The cloud DB's `tenant_plans` + `tenant_subscription` (with `signed_payload`/`signature`/`api_key` columns) mirror the license server's `subscriptions` — two sources of truth kept in sync manually |
| **Two deployments** | Two Northflank services to maintain, monitor, update |
| **No shared state** | "Free tier → no sync" is enforced from the cloud server's own `tenant_plans`, not from the license server's tier |

```

### What this buys

| Benefit | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **One deploy** | One image, one Northflank service, one reverse proxy |
| **No rewrite** | Both mature codebases are kept; only packaging + the Postgres path change |
| **Futureproof sync** | Sync data on Postgres (pooling, replicas, backups) — the part that scales |
| **Cheap auth** | License + website users stay on PocketBase/SQLite (low traffic, bounded) |
| **One identity** | The HS256 JWT's `tenant_id` is the single contract between the two functions |

### Honest constraints

- Two databases, not one. They are coupled by the JWT `tenant_id` (and the
  Stripe/Square webhooks mirror plan state into the sync DB), not by a shared
  table. If cross-database queries become necessary, that is the signal to
  merge auth data into Postgres.
- PocketBase remains single-node SQLite; it holds only low-traffic data.

---

## 3. Data Layout (Two Databases)

### Auth DB — PocketBase SQLite (unchanged)

```
license_keys, tenants, subscriptions, tenant_machines
web_users (future website — per website-plan.md)
```

### Sync DB — Postgres (the cloud server's 93 tables, unchanged)

```
offline_queue, products, tax_rates, users, terminals,
tenant_plans, tenant_subscription, stripe_customers,
processed_webhooks, payments, sales, sale_lines, …
```

### Identity contract

PocketBase `tenants.id` is the canonical tenant ID. The sync server's JWT mint
embeds it as the `tenant_id` claim, and every sync/REST row is scoped by that
string. The two databases never need to share a table — they share the
identifier.

### Plan gating (explicit coupling)

The sync function enforces "free → no sync" from its own `tenant_plans`,
updated by the Stripe/Square webhooks. The license server's `subscriptions`
remains the source of truth for the signed payload and tier key. These are
kept in step operationally today; unifying them into one table is a later,
optional step, not a prerequisite for one deploy.

---

## 4. Unified Auth Flow

### The two credentials that exist today

The two servers use two *different* credentials, and they serve different
purposes — one is durable identity, the other a short-lived session:

| Credential | Issued by | Lifetime | Carries | Used for |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Tenant `api_key`** | License server, `POST /api/v1/license/activate` | Persistent — no expiry, revoked explicitly | Tenant identity (stored on the `tenants` record) | License activation, renewal, status (`/api/v1/license/*`) |
| **HS256 JWT** | Cloud server, `POST /api/v1/tokens` (oz-api) | ~24 h (`exp` claim) | `tenant_id`, `terminal_id` scoping | Sync (`/api/sync/*`) and the REST API |

They are complementary, not competing. The `api_key` answers *"is this the
registered tenant?"*; the JWT answers *"is this an active session scoped to
that tenant and terminal?"*.

### Tenant `api_key` (identity — license server)

Issued on first activation, stored on the `tenants` record, and sent as
`Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`:

```
POS App first boot → user enters license key + email + machine_id
    │
    ▼
POST /api/v1/license/activate
    │
    ├── Go hook validates the key against license_keys
    ├── Finds or creates the tenant by email
    ├── Issues api_key (stored on the tenants record)
    ├── Signs the subscription payload with RSA-2048
    └── Returns { tenant_id, api_key, signed_payload, signature }

POS App subsequent boots
    │
    ├── Reads stored tenant_id + api_key from local SQLite
    └── POST /api/v1/license/status  { Authorization: Bearer <api_key> }
```

The `api_key` is not a JWT — it is a persistent secret verified directly
against the `tenants` collection. It never expires; it is revoked only on
explicit tenant action, subscription cancel + grace expiry, or an admin
security action.

### HS256 JWT (session — cloud server)

Minted by `POST /api/v1/tokens`, signed with `OZ_API_SECRET`, carrying `sub`,
`jti`, `exp`, `iat`, `tenant_id`, and `terminal_id` claims. The mint itself is
authorised one of three ways (ADR sync-auth-hardening): terminal client
credentials (`client_id` + `client_secret`), an `X-Admin-Key` header gated by
`OZ_ADMIN_KEY`, or — in dev only — an open mint when neither is configured.

```
POS App (before sync) → POST /api/v1/tokens
    │                    (client credentials | X-Admin-Key | open dev mint)
    ▼
oz-api create_token_scoped()
    │
    ├── Claims: tenant_id, terminal_id, exp = now + 24h
    └── Returns { token, expires_at, token_id }

POS App sync cycle
    │
    ├── POST /api/sync/push      { Authorization: Bearer <jwt> }
    ├── POST /api/sync/pull      { Authorization: Bearer <jwt> }
    ├── GET  /api/sync/snapshot  { Authorization: Bearer <jwt> }
    └── GET  /api/sync/status    { Authorization: Bearer <jwt> }
```

`auth_middleware` validates the JWT and injects its claims; the sync handlers
take `tenant_id` from the claims (never the request body) and the plan gate
(`OZ_ENFORCE_PLANS`) reads the same claim. On a structured 401
(`token_expired`) the client re-mints and retries once; `invalid_token` /
`missing_token` are surfaced as configuration errors.

### Refresh model

| Credential | Refresh strategy |
|-----------|------------------|
| `api_key` (identity) | No refresh — valid until revoked |
| JWT (session) | Re-mint at `POST /api/v1/tokens` on `token_expired` (no refresh token; minting is cheap) |

### Recommendation: keep both — unify only where they are verified

Do **not** collapse the two credentials into one:

- Making the `api_key` a JWT (or the JWT permanent) loses the short lifetime,
  the `terminal_id` scoping, and the expiry-based invalidation that sync and
  plan gating rely on.
- Making sync/REST use the raw `api_key` would send the long-lived identity
  secret on every data-plane request and lose the per-terminal scoping the
  JWT claims carry.

The merge should therefore:

1. Keep `api_key` on `tenants` for `/api/v1/license/*` (identity + activation).
2. Keep the HS256 JWT mint (`POST /api/v1/tokens`) and its auth middleware in
   the Rust sync server (session) — unchanged.
3. Use the JWT's `tenant_id` as the single identity contract: PocketBase
   `tenants.id` is the canonical ID, the JWT carries it, and the sync DB
   scopes rows by it. The two credentials coexist without one shared table.

---

## 5. Sync Protocol (Unchanged)

The Rust cloud server exposes four sync endpoints, all behind the oz-api JWT
(`auth_middleware`), per-tenant rate limiting, and optional plan gating
(`OZ_ENFORCE_PLANS`). The sync engine stays in the Rust server exactly as-is —
the POS client does not change. Only its database and its deployment move.

| Endpoint | Method | Contract |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `/api/sync/push` | POST | Accept a `Vec<OfflineQueueItem>`; insert each into `offline_queue` with its client-generated ID; tenant taken from JWT claims (never the body); per-item `Accepted` / `Rejected{reason}` (non-UUID id, duplicate id, db error) |
| `/api/sync/pull` | POST | Replay `offline_queue` rows for the tenant changed since `since`, ordered `created_at, id`, cursor-paginated (500/page); `410 anchor_expired` if `since` is older than the pruned window |
| `/api/sync/snapshot` | GET | Reference-data baseline — products, tax rates, users — scoped to the JWT tenant; 5-min in-memory cache; `pin_hash` never serialised (SYNC-06); query failures return 5xx, never an empty success (SYNC-09) |
| `/api/sync/status` | GET | Health, version, pending queue depth, tiered heartbeat interval |

### Push Flow

```
POS App → POST /api/sync/push
    │
    │  Headers: Authorization: Bearer <jwt from POST /api/v1/tokens>
    │  Body: [ { id, action, payload, status, retry_count, last_error,
    │           created_at, synced_at } ]        // Vec<OfflineQueueItem>
    │
    ▼
axum: push_handler (auth → plan gate → rate limit → handler)
    │
    ├── tenant_id = claims.tenant_id (never the request body)
    ├── For each item:
    │   ├── Reject non-UUID ids (defense-in-depth for the prune DELETE path)
    │   ├── INSERT INTO offline_queue (existing client-generated id)
    │   └── Duplicate id (UNIQUE) → Rejected { reason: "duplicate id" }
    └── Return PushResponse { results: [Accepted | Rejected] }
```

Push does NOT write to `products`/`sales` tables. The offline queue is a
pending-action ledger; reference data flows through the snapshot, and payment
events flow in through the Stripe/Square webhooks (as `finalize_sale` actions).

### Pull Flow (queue replay)

```
POS App → POST /api/sync/pull
    │
    │  Headers: Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
    │  Body: { since?: "2026-08-01T00:00:00Z", cursor?: "created_at|id" }
    │
    ▼
axum: pull_handler
    │
    ├── tenant_id = claims.tenant_id
    ├── If since is older than the oldest retained row → 410 anchor_expired
    ├── SELECT ... FROM offline_queue
    │     WHERE tenant_id = ? AND created_at >= since
    │     ORDER BY created_at ASC, id ASC LIMIT 501
    ├── Truncate to 500; if a 501st row existed, return next_cursor
    └── Return PullResponse { items, next_cursor }
```

### Snapshot (reference data, not the queue)

```
POS App → GET /api/sync/snapshot   (Authorization: Bearer <jwt>)
    │
    ▼
axum: snapshot_handler
    │
    ├── tenant_id = claims.tenant_id
    ├── Serve cached JSON if younger than 5 min
    ├── SELECT products, tax_rates, users WHERE tenant_id = ?
    ├── users: pin_hash deliberately omitted (SYNC-06)
    └── Return { products: [...], tax_rates: [...], users: [...] }
```

### Anti-spike & retention (must be preserved)

The sync function carries two DB-protection loops that are load-bearing and
must survive the SQLite → Postgres move — they are not optional:

| Mechanism | Today | Behavior |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Per-tenant rate limiter** (`rate_limit.rs`) | In-memory token bucket — DB-agnostic, already wired on both backends | push 100/min · pull 300/min · snapshot 50/min · status 300/min; token mint 30/min per IP; `429` + `Retry-After`; stale-bucket cleanup every 60 s |
| **Retention / prune loop** (`prune.rs`) | Hourly, now on **both** backends — `offline_queue` retention ported to Postgres (`start_prune_loop_pg`); `archive_stock_movements` + `incremental_vacuum` remain SQLite-only | delete `offline_queue` rows > 90 days regardless of status, in 500-row cursor batches (SQLite: `incremental_vacuum(50)` per batch; PG: autovacuum reclaims space); `archive_stock_movements` ledger rollup (SQLite only); `PRUNE_QUEUE_DELETED_TOTAL` counter |

Phase 1.5 has ported the offline-queue retention half of the prune loop to
Postgres (batched `DELETE ... id = ANY($1)`; `incremental_vacuum` becomes
autovacuum) and re-wired it onto the Postgres branch, and the report-sender
email loop now runs on Postgres too (`email_pg.rs` — settings + the full
analytics bundle, reusing the shared scheduler/filter/builder logic from
`oz_core`). Remaining on SQLite: the `archive_stock_movements` ledger rollup
only (deliberate — Postgres reclaims space via autovacuum, and the stock
rollup has no PG port). The rate limiter stays as-is: in-memory,
per-process, DB-agnostic.

### Key Change: co-locate, don't merge

| Aspect | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Sync handlers | Unchanged (Rust) |
| License handlers | Unchanged (Go/PocketBase) |
| Sync database | SQLite → Postgres (managed addon) |
| License database | PocketBase SQLite (unchanged) |
| Deployment | Two Northflank services → one image, one service |
| Identity | HS256 JWT `tenant_id` (already the contract) |

---

## 6. Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Finish the Postgres backend (Weeks 1-2)

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1.1 | Port the full 92-table migration set to Postgres DDL — **done**: `scripts/generate-pg-migration.py` → `20260813_init.pg.sql` (type-mapped, FK-order topo-sorted, 4 triggers → plpgsql); applied + verified idempotent on Postgres 16 (92 tables, 121 indexes, 4 triggers) |
| 1.2 | Make oz-api REST handlers run on Postgres (drop the in-memory SQLite fallback) — **done**: the sync function (`SyncStore`, via `SyncState.pg`), the REST surface (`crates/oz-api/src/pg.rs`, via `AppState.pg` — products, categories, tax_rates, users, plans, sales, terminals, token client-credentials), **and** the Stripe/Square webhook layer (dedup, `finalize_sale` enqueue, payment lookup, stripe-customer mapping, plan writes) all read/write Postgres on the cloud branch; the report-sender loop remains on SQLite |
| 1.3 | Raise the pool above the 8-connection default — **done**: `OZ_DB_POOL_SIZE` (default 20); TLS via rustls already wired |
| 1.4 | Migrate live sync data from SQLite to Postgres; verify row counts + checksums — **done**: `apps/cloud-server/src/bin/migrate_sqlite_to_pg.rs` copies the cloud surface (FK-topo-sorted from `pg_constraint`, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` so re-runs are safe, per-table row-count + FNV-1a checksum verification); verified end-to-end + idempotent re-run against live Postgres |
| 1.5 | Re-wire the background loops onto Postgres — **done**: prune (offline-queue retention) via `start_prune_loop_pg`, **and** the report-sender email loop via `email_pg::start_report_sender_loop_pg` (settings + analytics bundle on Postgres). Only the `archive_stock_movements` stock rollup remains SQLite-only (autovacuum supersedes it on PG). Rate-limit cleanup is DB-agnostic. |

#### Phase 1.2 — data-layer design (the remaining core)

`Store` cannot be rewritten to Postgres: it is the SQLite data layer for the
whole POS (desktop + tablet + cloud), a borrow-wrapper over
`&rusqlite::Connection` with ~45 domain modules, and the cloud server is only
one of its three consumers. Phase 1.2 therefore adds a **parallel async
Postgres data layer** for the cloud server and leaves `Store` untouched:

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Abstraction | `apps/cloud-server/src/sync_store.rs` — a `SyncStore` enum (`Sqlite` / `Postgres`) with one async surface over `deadpool_postgres::Pool` (no `blocking` feature; stay async). **Done** for the sync function. |
| Surface | Only what the cloud server uses: `offline_queue` (push/pull/prune), `tenant_plans` (get/set), `processed_webhooks` (dedup), stripe/square webhook tables, products/tax_rates/users (snapshot **and** REST CRUD), sales (REST create/get/status), terminals + token client-credentials, SMTP + report schedule (email loop). **Implemented**: `offline_queue` push/pull + counts, `tenant_plans` get/set, products/categories/tax_rates/users/plans/sales/terminals/tokens REST, prune retention, webhook dedup + `finalize_sale` + stripe-customer mapping, **and** the email/report loop (`email_pg.rs` — SMTP config, report schedule, dedup key, store name, and the full 10-query analytics bundle on Postgres). |
| SQL | Write Postgres SQL directly (`$1` params, `now() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'`, `ON CONFLICT`); no dialect shim |
| State | `SyncState` **and** `oz_api::AppState` hold `pg: Option<Pool>` (threaded through `build_router`); the Postgres branch passes `Some(pool)`, the SQLite branch `None`. `CloudServerState` also carries the pool so `/health` reports the real Postgres queue depth. |
| REST (oz-api) | **done** — `crates/oz-api/src/pg.rs` implements the REST surface against `deadpool_postgres::Pool`; every handler dispatches on `AppState::pg` (Postgres path vs. the untouched SQLite `Store` path). The Postgres branch no longer serves the empty in-memory SQLite. |
| Transactions | `tokio_postgres` `client.transaction()` for multi-row writes; `batch_execute` for the (already-done) migration |

Port order (highest value/risk first): **sync function** (offline_queue + plan
gating) — **done** → **prune loop, offline-queue retention** (1.5) — **done** →
**REST handlers** (1.2 tail) — **done** → **webhook dedup + `finalize_sale`**
— **done** (all webhook DB access is backend-aware; PG integration test
covers dedup, payment lookup, enqueue, tenant resolution, and plan upgrade)
→ **email loop** (1.5) — **done** (settings + analytics bundle on Postgres;
`pg_integration_email_loop_reads_postgres` covers revenue, heatmap, category
breakdown, low stock, and config round-trips) → **data migration** (1.4) —
**done** (binary + `pg_integration_migrate_and_verify`). Each landed
step has a skip-if-no-PG integration test (the established pattern) while the
SQLite branch keeps its full coverage.

### Phase 2: Combine into one image (Week 2) — complete

Status: **done** — `Dockerfile.unified`, `apps/unified/supervisord.conf`,
`apps/unified/Caddyfile`, `apps/unified/docker-entrypoint.sh`,
`apps/unified/healthcheck.sh`. Sync runs on SQLite until Phase 1 lands
(`DATABASE_URL` switches to Postgres with no packaging change).

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2.1 | Multi-stage Dockerfile building both binaries (unify libc) |
| 2.2 | Supervisor entrypoint running PocketBase (8080) + Rust (3099) |
| 2.3 | caddy reverse proxy on one port with path routing |
| 2.4 | One volume (pb_data + sync data), one aggregate healthcheck |

### Phase 3: Deploy one service (Week 3)

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 3.1 | Provision the managed Postgres addon on Northflank |
| 3.2 | Deploy the combined image; blue-green beside the two old services |
| 3.3 | Point the POS at the single URL; keep redirect mode (421) for stragglers |
| 3.4 | Decommission the two old Northflank services |

---

## 7. Code Changes Required

### Rust (cloud server — Postgres path)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `crates/oz-core/migrations/` | **done** — `20260813_init.pg.sql` + `generate-pg-migration.py`; exposed as `oz_core::migrations::PG_INIT`. The generator now emits `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on every seed INSERT, so re-applying `PG_INIT` on an existing volume is idempotent (verified live — cloud-server restarts work) |
| `apps/cloud-server/src/db.rs` | **done** — `connect_postgres` applies `PG_INIT` (full schema) instead of the 2-table stub; pool sized via `OZ_DB_POOL_SIZE` |
| `apps/cloud-server/src/main.rs` | **done** — the oz-api router receives the Postgres pool (`AppState.pg`), the prune loop starts on the Postgres branch (`start_prune_loop_pg`), the report-sender loop starts on the Postgres branch (`email_pg::start_report_sender_loop_pg`), and `/health` reports the real Postgres queue depth / `db: "postgres"` |
| `crates/oz-api/src/pg.rs` | **done** — the REST Postgres data layer (products, categories, tax_rates, users, plans, sales, terminals, token client-credentials); `PgError` → HTTP mapping; `SUM(...)::bigint` cast for stock (Postgres `SUM(bigint)` returns `numeric`); skip-if-no-PG integration test |
| `apps/cloud-server/src/webhooks.rs` | **done** — webhook dedup (`processed_webhooks` upsert + exists), payment → sale lookup, `finalize_sale` enqueue, stripe-customer mapping, and tenant-plan writes are backend-aware (`CloudServerState.pg`); PG integration test |
| `apps/cloud-server/src/prune.rs` | **done** — offline-queue retention ported to Postgres (`start_prune_loop_pg`, batched `DELETE ... id = ANY($1)`, autovacuum, `PRUNE_QUEUE_DELETED_TOTAL`); `archive_stock_movements` rollup remains SQLite-only |
| `apps/cloud-server/src/email.rs` | SQLite loop unchanged (desktop client path) |
| `apps/cloud-server/src/email_pg.rs` | **done** — Postgres report-sender loop: `settings` read/write (SMTP config + schedule + dedup key + store name) and the full 10-query analytics bundle (`daily/weekly/monthly revenue`, `top_products`, `hourly_heatmap`, `category_breakdown`, `low_stock`, `active_stock_alerts`, `category_popularity`, `category_forecast`) against `deadpool_postgres::Pool`, reusing `oz_core`'s shared scheduler/filter/`ReportEmailBuilder`; `should_send_scheduled_with_last_sent` extracted in `oz-core` so the two loops share one cadence/dedup implementation; skip-if-no-PG integration test |
| `apps/cloud-server/src/bin/migrate_sqlite_to_pg.rs` | **done** — Phase 1.4 cutover tool: copies the cloud surface from a SQLite file to Postgres (schema applied idempotently, rows via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), FK-topo-sorted copy order from `pg_constraint`, per-table row-count + FNV-1a checksum verification; `--dry-run`; unit tests + skip-if-no-PG integration test |
| `apps/cloud-server/src/rate_limit.rs` | Unchanged — in-memory and DB-agnostic; limits preserved |

### Packaging (new)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `Dockerfile.unified` | **done** — build both binaries into one image |
| `apps/unified/supervisord.conf` | **done** — run PocketBase + Rust under one supervisor |
| `apps/unified/Caddyfile` | **done** — one port, path-routed to 8080 / 3099 |
| `apps/unified/docker-entrypoint.sh` | **done** — volume ownership fix + exec supervisord |
| `apps/unified/healthcheck.sh` | **done** — aggregate healthcheck (both functions + DB ping) |

### Go (license server) + Rust (POS app)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `apps/license-server/*` | Unchanged (kept as the auth function) |
| `crates/oz-core/src/sync_client.rs` | Unchanged — same endpoints + token mint |
| `platform/startup/src/rate_sync.rs` | Point server URL defaults at the single service URL |

## 8. Environment Variables

### Auth function (PocketBase)

```bash
PB_DATA_DIR=/data/pb_data
PB_URL=https://api.oz-pos.com
OZ_LICENSE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----..."
# SMTP for web_users email (future website)
SMTP_HOST=... SMTP_PORT=587 SMTP_USERNAME=... SMTP_PASSWORD=...
```

### Sync function (Rust)

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/ozpos?sslmode=require  # require = encrypted via rustls (disable/prefer for local dev)
OZ_PRODUCTION=1                  # fail startup if OZ_API_SECRET/OZ_ADMIN_KEY unset; also implies OZ_DB_REQUIRE_TLS
OZ_DB_REQUIRE_TLS=1              # fail startup if DATABASE_URL omits sslmode=require (implied by OZ_PRODUCTION=1)
OZ_DB_POOL_SIZE=20               # max Postgres pool connections (positive integer; ignored for SQLite)
OZ_API_SECRET=...                # HS256 JWT signing secret — required when OZ_PRODUCTION=1 (unset falls back to the hard-coded dev secret; JWTs become forgeable)
OZ_ADMIN_KEY=...                 # gates POST /api/v1/tokens — required when OZ_PRODUCTION=1 (unset = open token mint, dev mode)
OZ_ENFORCE_PLANS=1               # reject free-plan sync (403 plan_required)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=...
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_URL=https://.../api/webhooks/square
OZ_API_PORT=3099
RUST_LOG=info
```

The two functions share one volume and one secret store; they communicate only
through the HS256 JWT, never directly.

## 9. API Endpoints (One Deployment)

### Auth function (PocketBase — kept)

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/v1/license/activate` | POST | Activate a key, issue the tenant `api_key`, sign the subscription |
| `/api/v1/license/renew` | POST | Renew a subscription |
| `/api/v1/license/status` | POST | Check status / revoke a machine (Bearer `api_key`) |
| `/api/collections/web_users/auth-*` | POST | Website auth (future, per website-plan.md) |

### Sync function (Rust — kept)

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/sync/push` | POST | Accept `OfflineQueueItem`s, insert with existing IDs, per-item outcomes |
| `/api/sync/pull` | POST | Replay `offline_queue` changes since a timestamp, cursor-paginated |
| `/api/sync/snapshot` | GET | Reference-data baseline (products, tax rates, users) |
| `/api/sync/status` | GET | Health, version, pending queue depth, heartbeat interval |
| `/api/v1/tokens` | POST | Mint HS256 JWT (`X-Admin-Key` / client credentials / dev) |
| `/api/webhooks/stripe` | POST | Subscription → plan; payment → `finalize_sale` |
| `/api/webhooks/square` | POST | Payment → `finalize_sale` |
| `/health` · `/metrics` | GET | Health + Prometheus metrics (incl. retention counter) |

## 10. Backward Compatibility

### Transition Period (~3 weeks)

| Client | Before | During Transition | After |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| POS App | Two URLs (license + sync) | One URL (reverse proxy), old services still up | One URL |
| Sync | Rust (SQLite) | Rust (Postgres, in parallel) | Rust (Postgres) |
| License | Go/PocketBase | Go/PocketBase | Go/PocketBase |

No protocol changes: the POS keeps the same HS256 JWT mint and the same
push/pull/snapshot/status calls. The existing redirect mode
(`OZ_REDIRECT_ONLY` + `OZ_SYNC_REDIRECT_URL`, HTTP 421) covers stragglers.

### Version Detection

```rust
// POS app can detect which server it's talking to
fn detect_server_version(base_url: &str) -> ServerVersion {
    // The unified server exposes the license endpoints alongside sync.
    if reqwest::get(format!("{}/api/v1/license/status", base_url)).is_ok() {
        ServerVersion::Unified
    } else {
        ServerVersion::Legacy
    }
}
```

## 11. Security, Reliability & Growth

### CORS Configuration

Lock to an explicit allowlist before serving the website:

| Origin | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `https://oz-pos.com` | Website (global) |
| `https://id.oz-pos.com` | Website (Indonesia) |
| `http://localhost:4321` | Website (dev) |
| `tauri://localhost` | POS app (Tauri) |

### Security Headers

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Prevent MIME sniffing |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Prevent clickjacking |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000` | Force HTTPS |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'self'` | Restrict resources |

### Hardening

- **Run Postgres with TLS** and a dedicated low-privilege role. The pool uses
  rustls, and `sslmode=require` is enforced at startup — via
  `OZ_DB_REQUIRE_TLS=1`, or automatically under `OZ_PRODUCTION=1` — so there
  is no silent plaintext fallback. The dedicated low-privilege role is still
  to be added.
- **Fail startup in prod if `OZ_API_SECRET` or `OZ_ADMIN_KEY` is unset.**
  `OZ_PRODUCTION=1` enforces both at startup — without it the JWT secret
  falls back to the hard-coded `oz-pos-dev-secret-change-in-production`
  (forgeable JWTs) and the token mint opens to anyone.
- **Rate-limit `/api/v1/tokens`** — done: 30/min per client IP (keyed on
  `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP`). License `/status` now shares the license
  server's persisted 5/IP/hr token bucket (was unthrottled).
- **Hash the tenant `api_key` at rest** — done: `tenants.api_key` now stores a
  bcrypt hash and `tenants.api_key_lookup` (hidden, uniquely indexed) stores a
  hex SHA-256 for O(1) lookup. `/renew` + `/status` resolve via
  `findTenantByAPIKey`; legacy plaintext rows are lazily migrated on their
  first successful auth. A re-activation without the key rotates it (the key
  is write-only). The legacy body-`api_key` fallback is **removed**: the
  `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` header is the sole credential channel on
  all three endpoints (body-only requests → 401 + `WWW-Authenticate` hint),
  and the desktop client sends the key via the header on activate/renew too
  (`#[serde(skip_serializing)]` keeps it out of the request body), so the
  secret can never land in CDN/access logs.
- **Keep the license server's 5/IP/hr activate/renew limiter** — it persists
  state to SQLite so restarts don't reset brute-force state; `/status` shares
  the same bucket.
- Store `OZ_API_SECRET`, `OZ_ADMIN_KEY`, and `OZ_LICENSE_PRIVATE_KEY` in
  Northflank secrets, never in the image.
- Lock down PocketBase's `/_/` admin UI (`DisableSignUp` + IP allowlist).
- The reverse proxy is the single public entry point; both app ports stay
  internal to the container.

### Reliability & operations

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Backups | Managed Postgres PITR **and** the PocketBase SQLite file (litestream or nightly `VACUUM INTO`); define RPO/RTO and run a restore drill |
| Aggregate healthcheck | Must check both processes, DB connectivity, and pending queue depth — not just "port is open" |
| Restart policy | Supervisor restarts each function independently; forward SIGTERM for graceful shutdown during rolling deploys |
| Alerting | Thresholds on: retention counter flatline, `offline_queue` depth, webhook 5xx, and token-mint rate |

### Growth path

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| A feature needs a cross-DB join (e.g. plan gate must read the license tier directly) | Merge the auth collections into Postgres; retire PocketBase SQLite |
| The sync function is scaled beyond one instance | Move the rate limiter **and** the 5-min snapshot cache out of process memory into a shared store (Redis) — both are per-process today |
| Schema changes ship | Adopt a Postgres migration tool (sqlx/refinery) so DDL is versioned, not ad-hoc `batch_execute` |
| Cross-tenant isolation must be provable | Done: the generated PG migration `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on all 15 tenant-scoped tables with a `tenant_isolation` policy keyed on the `oz.tenant_id` session GUC — a missed `WHERE tenant_id = ?` fails closed instead of leaking rows. `pg_integration_rls_fails_closed` proves it for a real non-owner role, and the deployment cutover is now shipped too: `scripts/rls-cutover.sql` creates the restricted `oz_app` role, grants DML, and `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`s the 15 tables; the sync data layer already issues `SET LOCAL oz.tenant_id` as the first statement of every request transaction (auto-resets on pool return). `pg_integration_rls_force_blocks_owner` executes the real script in a transaction and proves FORCE isolates even the table owner when the GUC is unset |
| A second tenant brings the same product SKU or username | Done: `UNIQUE (tenant_id, sku)` / `UNIQUE (tenant_id, username)` in both schemas, the four `products(sku)` child FKs (`bundle_items`, `product_bundles`, `product_taxes`, `product_variants`) reworked to composite `(tenant_id, sku)` FKs, and the by-SKU REST lookups (list/get/adjust stock, sale cost-freeze) tenant-scoped from the JWT claims. `pg_integration_tenant_sku_isolation` proves two tenants can share a SKU/username without seeing or mutating each other's rows. The desktop snapshot upserts (`ON CONFLICT (tenant_id, sku)` etc.) keep working single-tenant |

## 11.5 Post-Implementation Review (2026-08-15)

Full review of the merged Phase 1 code (commits `8d565711` → `dd6a362c`): every
REST handler, the sync store, prune, webhooks, the email/analytics port, the
1.4 migration tool, the generated schema, and the plan doc's claims.

### Fixed in this review

| Finding | Fix | Test |
|---------|-----|------|
| `adjust_stock` read the previous quantity **outside** the transaction — concurrent adjustments to one SKU could lose updates (SQLite's single-writer semantics had masked it) | Whole read-modify-write moved inside the tx with the product row locked (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`), serializing per-SKU adjustments | `pg_integration_concurrent_adjust_stock` — 20 concurrent `-1` adjustments must land as 20 ledger rows with final qty exactly `start − 20` |
| `update_sale_status` validated against a stale status — two concurrent transitions could both pass the state-machine check and double-apply | Compare-and-swap `UPDATE … WHERE id = $1 AND status = $2`; the loser re-reads and reports the current state | `pg_integration_concurrent_sale_status_transition` — exactly one of two concurrent `Pending→Active` wins; `version` bumps exactly once |
| `offline_queue` pulls filter `(tenant_id, created_at)` but no such index existed — every poll sorted the tenant's whole queue | Added `idx_offline_queue_tenant_created` to both schemas (regenerated `20260813_init.pg.sql` via the generator; index-surface guard bumped 121 → 122) | Existing `init_sql_creates_complete_schema_surface` guard |
| Stale comment claimed "the oz-api router requires SQLite" on the PG branch | Rewritten: REST handlers dispatch on `state.pg`; the in-memory SQLite is a never-written fallback | — |

### Verified clean (parity, no change needed)

- Every data-touching REST handler dispatches on `state.pg`; the in-memory SQLite fallback is never written in production PG mode, and `/health` reads the real Postgres queue depth.
- Analytics date math matches the SQLite engine: both interpret the stored UTC wall-clock; weekly grouping is Monday-first on both sides (`DATE(d, '-6 days', 'weekday 1')` ≡ `date_trunc('week', …)`).
- Snapshot column parity (`price_updated_at` defaults to `''` in both schemas); `track_serial`/`is_active` 0/1 BIGINT reads consistent.
- SMTP at rest: the PG loop decrypts via `oz_core::crypto` with the same static-key domain separation; plaintext legacy seeds degrade gracefully.
- No `unwrap()`/`expect()` in production cloud-server code; every client-supplied id stays parameter-bound (hostile-id prune tests).
- Migration tool: FK-topological copy order from `pg_constraint`, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, row-count + FNV-1a checksum verification, idempotent re-run verified live.
- `db.rs` TLS enforcement (`sslmode=require` fail-closed) and startup secret checks intact.

### Deferred (documented, not fixed)

1. ~~Global `UNIQUE(sku)` / `UNIQUE(username)`~~ — **done** in this pass (per-tenant constraints + composite FKs + tenant-scoped REST lookups + isolation test). The email-loop COGS/popularity joins were also hardened to `(tenant_id, sku)` so shared SKUs cannot cross tenants at the row level.
2. ~~Analytics scans use `created_at::date` (a cast, so `idx_sales_created_at` can't serve them)~~ — **SQLite done**: `idx_sales_status_created_date ON sales(status, date(created_at))` ships in the SQLite schema (guard 122 → 123) with a planner-proof test (`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` picks it, not `idx_sales_created_at`). **PG stays a scan** — text→date casts are STABLE in Postgres, so an expression index on `date(created_at)` is rejected as non-IMMUTABLE (verified against live PG 16); fine for a background daily job, revisited only if the bundle grows.
3. ~~Postgres Row-Level Security~~ — **done, including the cutover**. Schema side: the generator appends an RLS appendix to the PG migration (`ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + `tenant_isolation` policy on all 15 tenant-scoped tables, keyed on `current_setting('oz.tenant_id', true)` — unset ⇒ NULL ⇒ no rows). `pg_integration_rls_fails_closed` connects a real non-owner role on a dedicated connection and asserts: no GUC ⇒ zero rows visible and INSERT rejected ("row-level security"); GUC set ⇒ only that tenant's row visible, a shared SKU resolves to the right price, a cross-tenant INSERT is rejected, and UPDATE on the visible row succeeds. Deployment cutover (the last enforcement item): `scripts/rls-cutover.sql` is a runnable, idempotent script that creates the restricted non-owner `oz_app` role, grants DML on the 15 tenant tables, and `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`s them; the cloud sync data layer (`sync_store.rs`) opens every Postgres transaction with `SET LOCAL oz.tenant_id` (via `set_config(..., is_local := true)`) so the GUC auto-resets when the connection returns to the pool. `pg_integration_rls_force_blocks_owner` executes the real script verbatim inside a transaction (run twice for idempotency, 15 tables FORCEd, rollback restores), and proves on a dedicated non-superuser OWNED table that FORCE blocks the table owner without the GUC (zero rows, writes rejected) and unblocks with it. Also fixed while there: the `db.rs` PG integration tests hardcoded port 15432 and silently skipped in CI — they now read `OZ_TEST_PG_URL` like every other PG test.

### Multi-tenant readiness audit (2026-08-15)

Per-tenant uniqueness is in place; this is the remaining tenant-aware vs
tenant-blind surface, audited table by table.

| Surface | Status | Notes for the first real second tenant |
|---------|--------|----------------------------------------|
| `sync_api` handlers + `sync_store` (push/pull/snapshot/plan) | ✅ scoped | Tenant always resolved from JWT claims; per-tenant snapshot cache + rate limiter |
| `oz-api` REST (`pg.rs`) — products list/get/create/stock, tax rates, users, plans, terminals | ✅ scoped | Sale cost-freeze is tenant-scoped; `get_sale` / `update_sale_status` are by sale id (globally unique UUID — acceptable) |
| Webhook payment → sale lookup | ✅ scoped | Returns `(sale_id, tenant_id)` by joining the sale; the `finalize_sale` enqueue now runs under the sale's owner tenant (verified in the PG webhook test) |
| Webhook `finalize_sale` enqueue | ✅ scoped | Tenant flows from the sale row — no more hardcoded `'default'` |
| `sales` table | ✅ has `tenant_id` (default `'default'`) | Stamped by REST `create_sale` from the JWT claims; `payments` needs no tenant column (it joins through `sales.id`) |
| Report-sender email loop (`email_pg.rs`) | ✅ per-tenant | Every SKU-keyed product join resolves within the sale's tenant, and the loop now walks tenants: scoped settings keys (`{key}:{tenant}` with bare-key fallback), data-derived tenant enumeration (`default` first), a per-tenant advisory lock so a second instance skips instead of double-sending, and tenant-filtered aggregation (`AND s.tenant_id = $n` / `AND p.tenant_id = $n` in every sub-query). `pg_integration_email_loop_reads_postgres` asserts each tenant's bundle contains only its own sales and its own COGS (shared SKU), the scoped-key fallback, enumeration order, and the no-SMTP loop decision paths — see §11.5 "Per-tenant report scheduling" |
| Desktop `Store` (oz-core, SQLite) | ✅ single-tenant by construction | `create_sale` + the payment-completion paths stamp `tenant_id = 'default'` explicitly (asserted in `create_sale_persists_header`). The unscoped by-SKU/username queries are fine while each POS keeps its own DB file; the full inventory of what a shared-data rollout must scope is in §11.5 "Desktop Store tenant-scoping audit" (recommendation: a startup integrity check + the ~10 SKU/username-keyed statements, not a wholesale tenant API) |
| Health endpoint queue depth | ✅ global by design | Aggregate ops metric — correct as-is |

**Recommended Phase-4 order:** (1) ~~`sales.tenant_id` + REST/webhook threading~~ — **done** → (2) ~~per-tenant report settings + tenant-scoped analytics~~ — **done** (implemented below) → (3) ~~RLS~~ — **done**: schema-side (15 tables, `tenant_isolation` policy, fail-closed test) + deployment cutover (`scripts/rls-cutover.sql`: restricted `oz_app` role + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`; sync data layer issues `SET LOCAL oz.tenant_id` per request transaction; FORCE-blocks-owner proof test).

### Per-tenant report scheduling (implemented 2026-08-15)

Today the report-sender loop runs once per server, reads single-global
`settings` rows, and aggregates every tenant into one report. This design
makes each tenant get its own report on its own schedule to its own
recipients, aggregated from its own rows — without breaking the existing
single-tenant behaviour.

**1. Tenant-scoped settings keys.** Settings stay in the single `settings`
table; the key carries the tenant as a **suffix**: `smtp_config:{tenant}`,
`report_schedule:{tenant}`, `last_report_sent_at:{tenant}`, `store.name:{tenant}`.
The bare keys (`smtp_config`, …) remain the canonical location for
`default`, so a read falls back `{base}:{tenant}` → bare `{base}`, and
`default`'s existing rows keep working untouched. Suffix (not prefix)
because it is a plain PK lookup — no `LIKE` scan — and it leaves the
legacy reads byte-identical. Recipients already live inside
`ReportScheduleConfig`, so no new settings surface is needed. Provisioning
is now covered by the admin-gated settings endpoint (`GET/PUT
/api/v1/settings`, `X-Admin-Key` like token minting): PUT validates the
SMTP/schedule JSON against the loop's types, encrypts the SMTP password
at rest, always writes the scoped `{base}:{tenant}` keys, and treats an
explicit `null` as "delete the override" (falling back to the bare key);
GET returns the effective per-tenant view with the bare-key fallback
applied — a second tenant is enabled purely by provisioning its scoped
keys through the endpoint, with no data migration.

**2. Tenant enumeration.** There is no `tenants` table; derive the active
set from data (cheap, no schema change, and a tenant exists the moment it
has a plan, a terminal, or queue activity):

```sql
SELECT tenant_id FROM tenant_plans
UNION SELECT DISTINCT tenant_id FROM offline_queue
UNION SELECT DISTINCT tenant_id FROM sync_terminals;
```

Growth path: when signup/provisioning lands (the website), introduce a
`tenants` table and enumerate from it, keeping the union as an orphan
fallback. `default` is always processed first so the current behaviour is
a byte-identical special case.

**3. The loop.** One background task; each cycle: enumerate tenants → for
each, read its scoped settings → if `enabled` and due (reuse the existing
tenant-agnostic `should_send_scheduled_with_last_sent` with its scoped
`last_report_sent_at`) → generate its bundle → send → stamp the scoped
last-sent. **Failure isolation:** per-tenant errors are logged and the
cycle continues; only a DB-level failure aborts. Tenants process
sequentially in `tenant_id` order for deterministic log output.

**4. Tenant-scoped aggregation.** `export_analytics_bundle_pg` already
takes `tenant_id` (today it only labels metadata) — thread it into every
sub-query (`AND s.tenant_id = $n` on sales-driven queries,
`AND p.tenant_id = $n` on product-driven ones). The joins already resolve
within the sale's tenant (previous work); the `WHERE` filter is what
isolates the aggregation itself.

**5. Concurrency & scale-out.** Single instance needs nothing extra
(sequential per-tenant work in one task). Multiple instances must not
send the same tenant's report twice: wrap each tenant's send in a
`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(tenant_id))` so the other instance skips
it. The at-most-once gap (a crash between a successful send and the
last-sent stamp could duplicate) is closed by the `sent_reports
(tenant_id, period, report_id)` table — **implemented**: the period
(daily/weekly/monthly calendar bucket in the schedule's timezone) is
claimed with `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (tenant_id, period) DO NOTHING`
BEFORE generating or sending; a second claim loses and the cycle skips,
so a crash-recovery restart or a racing instance can never re-send the
same period. The claim is released only when the send definitively
fails (allowing a retry); a send that succeeded but whose SMTP response
was lost is the unavoidable at-least-once boundary of email delivery.

**6. Rollout.** No data migration: existing bare keys are `default`'s
config. A second tenant is enabled purely by provisioning its scoped
keys. Tests: extend `pg_integration_email_loop_reads_postgres` to seed a
second tenant's scoped settings + rows and assert each tenant receives
only its own bundle (the shared-SKU COGS test already proves the row
isolation half); unit-test the key-scoping fallback.

**✅ Implemented (2026-08-15), all six points landed in `email_pg.rs`:**

- Settings: `get_setting_scoped_pg` / `set_setting_scoped_pg` +
  `scoped_key` (suffix form); `get_smtp_config_pg` /
  `get_report_schedule_pg` / `get_store_name_pg` / `category_means_pg`
  all take the tenant and read scoped-first with bare-key fallback.
- Enumeration: `active_tenants_pg` = `tenant_plans ∪ offline_queue ∪
  sync_terminals` + always `default`, sorted `default`-first.
- Loop: `try_send_scheduled_pg` walks tenants sequentially; per-tenant
  errors are logged and the cycle continues.
- Aggregation: `tenant_id` is threaded into every analytics sub-query
  (`daily/weekly/monthly revenue` incl. their COGS subqueries,
  `top_products`, `hourly_heatmap`, `category_breakdown`, both stock
  alert queries, `category_popularity`'s three queries, and the
  popularity-trend sales + activity queries).
- Concurrency: **one deviation from the design** — the design said
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock`, but the cycle's helpers each use independent
  pooled connections, so a transaction-scoped lock would guard nothing.
  `try_send_scheduled_for_tenant_pg` instead holds a **session**
  `pg_try_advisory_lock(hashtext(tenant_id))` on one dedicated
  connection for the whole read-due → send → stamp cycle; a second
  instance gets `false` and skips the tenant. Released on every exit
  path; worst case it dies with the connection on recycle.
- Tests (all in `pg_integration_email_loop_reads_postgres`): per-tenant
  bundle isolation (each tenant sees only its own sales and COGS), scoped
  key wins + bare-key fallback after deleting the scoped row, enumeration
  order, and the no-SMTP loop decision paths (already-sent tenant
  short-circuits before SMTP; unknown tenant skipped cleanly).
- At-most-once send: the new `sent_reports (tenant_id, period,
  report_id)` table (93rd table, both schemas; RLS-enrolled via the
  generator) is claimed before the email is sent
  (`claim_period_pg` — `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), so a crash between a
  successful send and the last-sent stamp — or a racing instance — is
  recovered by the next cycle seeing the claim and skipping; the claim
  is released only on an observed send failure
  (`release_period_pg`). `period_for_schedule` buckets by cadence in
  the schedule's timezone (`YYYY-MM-DD` daily, Monday `YYYY-MM-DD`
  weekly, `YYYY-MM` monthly), reusing the now-public
  `resolve_now_in_timezone`. Tests: cadence bucketing unit test,
  live-PG claim-wins/second-claim-loses/release-retries, and a due
  schedule with a pre-claimed period that returns Ok without ever
  attempting SMTP.
- Provisioning: `crates/oz-api/src/routes/settings.rs` ships the
  admin-gated `GET/PUT /api/v1/settings` endpoint (registered in
  `oz-api`'s public router, `X-Admin-Key` like token minting). PUT
  validates `SmtpConfig`/`ReportScheduleConfig`, encrypts the SMTP
  password at rest (`encrypt_smtp_at_rest`), writes scoped suffix keys on
  SQLite and Postgres, and maps explicit `null` → delete override via a
  `deserialize_with` helper (plain `Option<Option<T>>` cannot distinguish
  null from absent — serde collapses both to `None`). GET resolves the
  effective view with the same scoped-first/bare-fallback order the loop
  uses. Tests: admin gating, typed round-trip, at-rest encryption (raw
  row inspected), per-tenant isolation, bare-key fallback (legacy bare
  row seeded directly), null-delete, validation rejects, and a live-PG
  provision round-trip (`pg_integration_settings_provision_per_tenant`).

### Desktop Store tenant-scoping audit (2026-08-15)

Per-tenant `UNIQUE (tenant_id, sku)` / `UNIQUE (tenant_id, username)` is
live in the schema, so the desktop `Store`'s unscoped queries are now the
only place a bare SKU/username lookup can multi-match. This is the
inventory of what a real multi-tenant rollout must scope.

**The surface (oz-core, SQLite `Store`):**

| Bucket | Where | Statements |
|--------|-------|------------|
| SKU-keyed product reads/writes | `db/products.rs` | get by sku (672), by barcode (685), duplicate check (649), partial update (536), `track_serial` update (698), delete (717), id-by-sku (915); category cleanup (845) |
| id-keyed product reads | `db/products.rs` | sku-by-id (929), `product_type`-by-id (943), list queries (173–290, 1103) |
| Cross-file SKU lookups/joins | `db/sales.rs` (cost freeze 129, line validate 738/789), `inventory.rs`, `refunds.rs`, `kds.rs`, `stock_counts.rs`, `stock_transfers.rs`, `shifts.rs`, `settings.rs` | ~76 sku-keyed statements across 10 files; most are `WHERE sku = ?` reads, a handful are test literals |
| Username-keyed user reads/writes | `db/staff.rs` | list (157), by id (178), by username (282), create (349, 721…), update (407, 438), delete (457) |
| Lists & aggregations | `db/products.rs`, `db/staff.rs`, `db/reports.rs`, `db/popularity.rs`, `db/analytics.rs` | whole-table scans — safe only because the desktop DB is single-tenant by construction |
| Already tenant-aware | `sync_client.rs` | snapshot upserts conflict on `(tenant_id, sku)` / `(tenant_id, username)` |

**What actually breaks if a desktop DB ever holds a foreign-tenant row:**

1. **SKU/username-keyed single-row reads and writes** — with per-tenant
   uniqueness, `WHERE sku = ?` can return one row per tenant; `query_row`
   errors on multi-match and writes hit the wrong row. This is the small,
   must-fix set: products.rs 536/649/672/685/698/717/915 + sales.rs
   129/738/789 + staff.rs 282, each gaining `AND tenant_id = 'default'`
   (or a tenant parameter).
2. **Cross-file SKU joins** (stock, refunds, KDS, reports) — same
   multi-match ambiguity; scope by `(tenant_id, sku)` when touched.
3. **id-keyed reads** (929, 943, staff 178, 407/438/457) — UUIDs are
   globally unique so nothing breaks, but a cross-tenant id lookup is a
   leak vector; add the filter for defense-in-depth.
4. **Lists & aggregations** — only a leak if foreign rows exist; no
   change needed while each POS keeps its own DB file.

**Recommended approach (not sprinkling 40+ `WHERE tenant_id` clauses):**

- **Scope by construction**: the desktop/tablet app keeps one DB file per
  store, so foreign rows should never exist. Add a cheap startup
  integrity check (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE tenant_id !=
  'default'`) that fails loudly if they appear, instead of rewriting the
  whole Store.
- **Fix the must-break set** (bucket 1, ~10 statements) when multi-tenancy
  actually ships.
- **Defer** id-keyed defense-in-depth and the aggregation surface until
  the Store is ever pointed at shared data — today the cloud syncs
  reference data *into* the local DB rather than reading from it.

This mirrors how the cloud side was handled: per-tenant constraints + the
queries that break under them, not a wholesale tenant API.

### Test plan (what proves the port is right)

| Area | Test | Backend |
|------|------|---------|
| REST round-trip (product/tax/user/plan/sale/terminal, oversell, state machine) | `pg_integration_rest_roundtrip` (oz-api) | live PG |
| Concurrency (stock, status transitions) | the two `pg_integration_concurrent_*` tests | live PG |
| Multi-tenant isolation (shared SKU/username across tenants) | `pg_integration_tenant_sku_isolation` | live PG |
| Sync store push/pull/snapshot/plan | `pg_integration_sync_store_*` (cloud-server) | live PG |
| Webhooks dedup, tenant resolution, plan writes | `pg_integration_webhooks_read_write_postgres` | live PG |
| Prune retention batching + hostile-id-as-data | `pg_integration_prune_*` + unit tests | live PG + SQLite |
| Email analytics bundle + settings | `pg_integration_email_loop_reads_postgres` | live PG |
| SQLite → Postgres cutover | migration bin unit tests + live-PG integration incl. idempotent re-run | live PG |
| CI gate | Postgres service container added to `ci.yml` (`rust-test-fast` + `rust-test-apps`) with `OZ_TEST_PG_URL`, so the skip-if-unreachable tests can no longer silently skip in CI | CI |

All tests run with `OZ_TEST_PG_URL` set against one Postgres 16 and coexist
(unique namespaces + cleanup); `cargo test -p oz-api` 154, `oz-cloud-server`
162, `oz-core --lib` 1773, migration bin 5.

### Implementation audit (2026-08-15): claims vs. code

Re-read the whole plan and checked every load-bearing claim against the
implementation. **Verified present and tested:** `OZ_PRODUCTION=1` startup
secret enforcement (+ `production_requires_both_secrets`), `OZ_PRODUCTION`
→ `OZ_DB_REQUIRE_TLS` implication, `sslmode=require` fail-closed,
`/api/v1/tokens` rate limit (30/min/IP), license `api_key` bcrypt + SHA-256
lookup with lazy legacy migration, the license 5/IP/hr activate limiter
(SQLite-persisted), the plan gate (`OZ_ENFORCE_PLANS` → 403
`plan_required`), redirect mode (`OZ_REDIRECT_ONLY` → 421), the per-tenant
5-min snapshot cache (tenant-keyed, adaptive TTL), the `/health` +
`/metrics` endpoints (incl. `PRUNE_QUEUE_DELETED_TOTAL`), Stripe/Square
signature verification tests, the unified packaging files, and SIGTERM
handling in supervisord.

**Gaps found (the improvement list below).** All are either small code
items with tests, or documented deployment items — nothing contradicts the
plan's design.

### Next improvements (2026-08-15 audit) — prioritized, with tests

| # | Improvement | Why | Tests to add |
|---|-------------|-----|-------------|
| 1 | **CORS allowlist** — replace `allow_origin(Any)` in `oz-api` with an env-configured list (`OZ_CORS_ORIGINS`, defaulting to the §11 origins + `http://localhost:4321`); `Any` stays only when the env explicitly says so | The doc requires an explicit allowlist before the website ships; today every origin gets `access-control-allow-origin: *` | allowed origin → CORS headers present; disallowed origin → no `access-control-allow-origin`; preflight (`OPTIONS`) still 200 for allowed origins; dev default keeps localhost working |
| 2 | **Security headers middleware** on the oz-api + cloud routers: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Strict-Transport-Security` (production only), `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'` | §11 lists all four; none are set today | a sample route (health) returns all four headers; HSTS absent in dev, present when `OZ_PRODUCTION=1` |
| 3 | **Analytics expression index** — `CREATE INDEX idx_sales_status_created_date ON sales (status, date(created_at))`, **SQLite-only** (SQLite guard bumped 122 → 123); the generator skips it for PG with a comment | Deferred item 2 in §11.5: the report queries filter `status = 'completed'` + `DATE(created_at) BETWEEN …`; the cast defeats `idx_sales_created_at` today. **PG can't have it**: text→date casts are STABLE (DateStyle-dependent), so `CREATE INDEX` on `date(created_at)` is rejected as non-IMMUTABLE (verified against live PG 16) — the PG report job stays a scan (fine for a background daily job) | `analytics_query_uses_status_created_date_index` runs `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` and asserts the SQLite planner picks the new index (and NOT `idx_sales_created_at`); the email PG analytics test still green; `PG_INIT` still applies cleanly |
| 4 | **`sent_reports` retention** — the PG prune cycle now deletes claims older than 90 days (same horizon as `offline_queue`), after the queue loop | The dedup table grows one row per (tenant, period) forever; old claims are only useful while a crash-recovery retry window could still collide | `pg_integration_prune_ages_out_old_sent_reports` (live-PG): seeds an old claim + fresh claims for two tenants → only the old one is swept, fresh claims for *both* tenants survive (no over-delete); new `prune_sent_reports_deleted_total` counter mirrors the queue one |
| 5 | **Desktop tenant-foreign-row startup check** — **done**: `Store::check_tenant_integrity()` (two indexed COUNTs on `idx_products_tenant`/`idx_users_tenant`, naming the offending table(s)) wired into both `AppState::new` startup paths (desktop + tablet) right after migrations — a foreign row refuses to boot | §11.5's desktop audit recommends exactly this instead of sprinkling 40+ `WHERE tenant_id` clauses; today only `PRAGMA integrity_check` (page corruption) exists | `check_tenant_integrity_passes_on_clean_db` (clean + default-tenant rows); `_rejects_foreign_product` / `_rejects_foreign_user` (error names the table); `_reports_both_violations` — all in `backup_restore_integration.rs` |
| 6 | **RLS deployment cutover** — **done**: `scripts/rls-cutover.sql` (idempotent, pure SQL: creates restricted non-owner `oz_app` role, grants DML on the 15 tenant tables, `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on all 15; header documents the webhook/`distinct_tenant_count` GUC exceptions) + the cloud sync data layer now opens every Postgres transaction with `SET LOCAL oz.tenant_id` (`set_config(..., is_local := true)`, auto-reset on pool return) | The last enforcement item; schema-side RLS shipped + proven, but the owner bypassed it | `pg_integration_rls_force_blocks_owner` (live-PG): executes the real script verbatim in a transaction twice (idempotency; 15 tables FORCEd; rollback restores), then proves on a dedicated non-superuser OWNED table that FORCE blocks the owner without the GUC (0 rows + INSERT rejected) and unblocks with it; the sync PG roundtrip test stays green through the transaction refactor |
| 7 | **License server** — **done**: `/status` now shares the persisted 5/IP/hr token bucket (applied before auth, like activate/renew), and the legacy body-`api_key` fallback is **removed** from all three endpoints — the `Authorization: Bearer` header is the sole credential channel (body-only → 401 + `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` hint; activate still allows a credential-less first activation). The desktop client matches: activate/renew send the key via `.bearer_auth()` and `#[serde(skip_serializing)]` keeps it out of the request body | Both were documented gaps (§11): `/status` was unthrottled; the body fallback leaked the secret into access logs | `TestStatusHandler_RateLimited` (6th `/status` call in an hour → 429); `TestRenewHandler_RejectsBodyAPIKey` + the AuthPaths tables (body-only → 401 + `WWW-Authenticate`; header wins when both present, body ignored); all pre-existing handler tests migrated to the Bearer header; Rust `renew_license_request_serializes_snake_case` asserts `api_key` never appears in the request body |
| 8 | **Doc hygiene** — §12 risk row still says "92-table schema" (→ 93), and the §11.5 test matrix lacks the RLS, per-tenant email, settings-endpoint, and `sent_reports` rows | Keep the plan doc truthful | — |
| 9 | **Operations checklist (deploy-time)** — **done**: `docs/operations/runbook.md` now documents Postgres PITR (managed addon, RPO ≤ 5 min / RTO ≤ 1 h, monthly restore drill), PocketBase backup (litestream **or** nightly `VACUUM INTO` / `scripts/backup-db.sh`, RPO ≤ 24 h), the desktop `backup-db.sh`/`restore-db.sh` pair, a quarterly two-DB restore drill checklist, Prometheus rules for retention flatline, queue depth (polling `/health` — a JSON field, not a gauge), webhook 5xx, token-mint rate, sync 429s, health degraded, pull decode failures, and DB contention, plus the RLS cutover deploy step and the startup-secret/TLS fail-closed contract; and `rate_limit_429_total{limiter}` + `webhook_5xx_total` counters ship with `metrics_render_rate_limit_and_webhook_counters` (drives both paths through a real router and asserts `/metrics` renders them) | §11 reliability table items are all still paper | a `docs/operations/` runbook entry; the metrics additions get a smoke test that the endpoint renders the new counters |

Items 1–5 + 8 are self-contained code/doc slices with tests (each ~1 commit).
Item 6 is the big remaining enforcement step (deployment + request wiring).
Items 7 and 9 touch the Go license server / ops runbook respectively.

## 12. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Postgres path was a 2-table stub | **Resolved** — full 93-table schema + sync function + prune retention + REST handlers + webhooks + the report-sender email loop + the 1.4 migration tool all run on Postgres; the only remaining SQLite surface is the `archive_stock_movements` stock rollup (deliberate — autovacuum supersedes it) |
| Prune/report loops are SQLite-only (`incremental_vacuum`, `rusqlite::Connection`) | Offline-queue retention is ported + re-wired on Postgres (step 1.5) and the report-sender loop runs on Postgres (`email_pg`); only the `archive_stock_movements` rollup remains SQLite-only (autovacuum supersedes it on PG); retention counter confirms aging |
| In-memory rate limiter is per-process | Fine for one node; move to a shared store (Redis) only if the sync function is scaled out |
| Snapshot cache is also in-memory | Same — Redis/shared store on scale-out |
| Dev-secret fallback / open token mint in prod | Fail startup if `OZ_API_SECRET` / `OZ_ADMIN_KEY` unset |
| Postgres pool was `NoTls` | Now rustls; startup fails unless `DATABASE_URL` sets `sslmode=require` (`OZ_DB_REQUIRE_TLS=1` or `OZ_PRODUCTION=1`) |
| `api_key` stored plaintext | Done: bcrypt + SHA-256 lookup; legacy rows migrated lazily |
| PocketBase SQLite has no backup | litestream / nightly `VACUUM INTO` + restore drill |
| Data loss during SQLite → Postgres | Back up SQLite, verify row counts + checksums, replay window |
| Two databases drift | JWT `tenant_id` is the single identity; webhooks mirror plan state; reconcile if a cross-DB query appears |
| Supervisor / reverse proxy failure | Aggregate healthcheck; keep the two processes independently restartable |
| POS breakage | No protocol change; redirect mode (421) catches stragglers |
| PocketBase single-node | Holds only low-traffic auth data; migrate web_users to a hosted provider if it outgrows |
| Sync conflicts | Version-based optimistic concurrency (existing) |
| Lost stock updates under concurrency (read-outside-tx) | Fixed: `adjust_stock` locks the product row (`FOR UPDATE`) inside the tx; concurrent-adjust test proves no lost updates |
| Double-applied sale status transitions under concurrency | Fixed: compare-and-swap `UPDATE … WHERE status = $current`; concurrent-transition test proves exactly one winner |
| PG integration tests silently skip in CI | Fixed: Postgres service container + `OZ_TEST_PG_URL` in `ci.yml` (`rust-test-fast`, `rust-test-apps`) |

---

## 13. Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Phase 1**: Finish Postgres backend | 1-2 weeks | Full schema + oz-api on Postgres + data migration |
| **Phase 2**: Combine into one image | 1 week | Dockerfile + supervisor + reverse proxy |
| **Phase 3**: Deploy one service | 1 week | Northflank service + Postgres addon + cutover |
| **Total** | ~3-4 weeks | One deployment, two functions |

---

## 14. Success Criteria

| Criterion | How to Verify |
|-----------|---------------|
| One deployment | One Northflank service, one image, one public URL |
| Two functions | PocketBase (auth) + Rust (sync) both healthy in the one container |
| Sync on Postgres | Sync, prune, REST, webhook, and email/report reads/writes hit Postgres; the in-memory SQLite REST fallback is gone — the only remaining SQLite surface is the `archive_stock_movements` rollup (deliberate; autovacuum supersedes it) |
| License works | activate/renew/status behave as today |
| Sync works | POS pushes/pulls via the unchanged contract |
| Webhooks work | Stripe/Square update plans and enqueue `finalize_sale` |
| One identity | JWT `tenant_id` scopes every sync row to the canonical tenant |
| No data loss | Row counts + checksums match after the SQLite → Postgres migration |
| Anti-spike loops survive | Rate limits still return `429`; the hourly prune ages `offline_queue` on Postgres and the retention counter increments; the report-sender loop runs on Postgres; the `stock_movements` rollup remains SQLite-only (deliberate) |
| Secrets enforced | `OZ_PRODUCTION=1` fails startup unless `OZ_API_SECRET` and `OZ_ADMIN_KEY` are set (no dev fallback / open mint) |
| Backups verified | A restore drill recovers both Postgres and PocketBase SQLite to a known point |
| Alerts fire | A flatlined retention counter or growing queue depth pages a human |
